leonard bernstein remembrances
in addition to the leonard bernstein tribute that is part of the los angeles philharmonic program this weekend, other local orchestras are also planning special remembrances.
sunday at royce hall, the american youth symphony has added local composer leon levitch's elegy for strings -- a personal choice from conductor mehli mehta -- to the program to honor bernstein, who died last sunday.
also, opening the new season of the glendale symphony season on sunday at dorothy chandler pavilion, music director lalo schifrin will observe a moment of silence to honor his longtime friend and colleague.
last monday, kusc-fm (91.5) devoted its entire day of live broadcasting, from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m., to performances -- as conductor and pianist -- and compositions of bernstein, including an unusual recording from 1956 of him discussing beethoven's fifth symphony.
kkgo-fm (105.1) also devoted a considerable amount air time to bernstein's work on tuesday and wednesday.
another measure of grief came from the obituary section of the new york times, which includes a section of special classified ads for public condolences at $15.85 a line.
the outpouring of emotions following bernstein's death filled almost 200 lines (15 inches of small type) and encompassed 14 separate tributes.
among the contributors were conductors zubin mehta and kurt masur, as well as peter martins of the new york ballet and christopher keene of the new york city opera.
"leonard bernstein.
.. is now being mourned by the entire world.
i personally have lost a dear friend".
wrote mehta in his tribute.
"i was proud to be associated with him at the new york philharmonic and the israel philharmonic orchestra, both of which he considered family".
"this is perhaps not unusual for a prominent member of the jewish community involved with philanthropic activities," reported irv horowitz, the new york times obituary editor.
he said the biggest similar reaction he could recall came after the recent death of the mother of the new york times publisher.
"that was considerably larger," horowitz said.
the bernstein family has requested contributions in lieu of flowers be made to the bernstein education through the arts fund ï¿½inc.
