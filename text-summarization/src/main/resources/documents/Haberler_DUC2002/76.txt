honecker fate still undecided gorbachev urges a go-slow approach  
germany wants to try him for ordering the shooting of people who attempted to flee to the west during his years in power.
but speculation lingers that german politicians have little real interest in trying a man who may possess embarrassing secrets.
"let's forget about the issue of erich honecker for several days.
let's hope this special issue will be resolved," gorbachev's spokesman, andrei grachev, quoted the soviet president as telling german media.
but tass quoted gorbachev as saying he did not exclude the possibility that honecker would leave russia for north korea in the next few days.
gorbachev had served as honecker's protector until the soviet leader's political fortunes declined.
last week russia abruptly ordered honecker to leave the country or face expulsion.
north korean and russian diplomats confirmed that talks were held tuesday about a north korean offer for honecker to travel to pyongyang, the north korean capital, for medical treatment.
li cher gvan, a consul at the north korean embassy, said a commercial north korean airliner remained at moscow's sheremetyevo airport ready to fly honecker to pyongyang.
but he said his country was still awaiting a positive reply from the russian government on the offer to accept honecker.
the russian foreign ministry said it had not yet formulated a response.
outside the chilean embassy, several dozen demonstrators continued their vigil, demanding humane treatment for honecker.
