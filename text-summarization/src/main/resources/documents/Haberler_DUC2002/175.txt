ft  21 jul 92 / commodities and agriculture: poland's copper combine hit by strike
workers at kghm, poland's copper producing combine went on strike yesterday as coal mining unions staged token stoppages in a third of the country's pits in a major challenge to the government's economic policies.
the strike at kghm in lubin, western poland, where mining unions representing some 40,0000 workers have been demanding a 30 per cent wage increase, came despite a management offer at the weekend to increase wages by 20 per cent. further increases could only come if the government eased prohibitive wage control taxes, thus providing a powerful precedent for wage demands by other groups.
meanwhile coal mining unions are also demanding wage increases as well as a clear restructuring strategy for their industry after last week's scattered stoppages in some 15 of poland's 71 pits wrung promises of wage rises that cash strapped managements can ill afford.
in contrast to the copper industry, which continues to show a profit, coal mining is running at a loss with subsidies stopped in march as the government moved to control the budget deficit.
the industry is experiencing a coal glut with pit head, power station and export stocks amounting to some 12m tonnes, the equivalent of a month's output.
this has led to temporary lay-offs, which have hit miners' incomes and led to the present bout of unrest.
polish mines produced 69.7m tonnes of coal in the first half of the year or 1.5 per cent less than in the same period last year.
meanwhile kghm produced 197,000 tonnes of refined copper in the same period or 3.9 per cent more than in the first half of 1991.
