imagine: a john lennon elegy 
``i believe in fairies, the myths, dragons.
it all exists, even if it's in your mind.
who's to say that dreams and nightmares aren't as real as the here and now? reality leaves a lot to the imagination''.
_ john lennon.
watching the new movie, ``imagine: john lennon,'' was very painful for the late beatle's wife, yoko ono.
``the only reason why i did watch it to the end is because i'm responsible for it, even though somebody else made it,'' she said. 
cassettes, film footage and other elements of the acclaimed movie were collected by ono.
she also took cassettes of interviews by lennon, which were edited in such a way that he narrates the picture. 
andrew solt (``this is elvis'') directed, solt and david l. wolper produced and solt and sam egan wrote it.
``i think this is really the definitive documentary of john lennon's life,'' ono said in an interview. ``what john was really about is depicted in this film, very accurately and without whitewashing.
``i did view it. i didn't have them take any footage out.
``i wanted the truth. in the sense you had to put a 40-year life into an hour and a half; balance is a very serious consideration. 
i think they did a remarkable job and very tastefully so.''
there is a soundtrack album and a coffeetable book with comments primarily by lennon, tied in with the film and using the same title.
