several insurers' net  to be cut in quarter by hurricane hugo 
damage from hurricane hugo, which stormed through the carolinas and the caribbean last week, will reduce third-quarter earnings for several insurers.
new york-based american international group inc.
expects net losses related to hugo to reduce pretax earnings between $35 million and $45 million.
analysts said aig has told them that it must cover the first $35 million of losses and that its reinsurance agreements will cover the bulk of the remaining damages.
aig insured property in puerto rico, the eastern caribbean islands and the coastal regions of the carolinas.
st. paul cos.
, based in st.
paul, minn, said the pretax cost of hugo shouldn't exceed $50 million.
that amount takes into consideration what st.
paul expects to recover under its reinsurance contracts, the company said.
philadelphia-based cigna corp.
is expected to disclose hugo's likely impact on its earnings sometime today.
udayan ghose, an insurance industry analyst at shearson lehman hutton in new york, estimates that cigna's third-quarter per-share earnings could be reduced by between 50 cents and 65 cents a share on an after-tax basis.
that would wipe out 35% to 40% of his $1.40-a-share earnings estimate for the third quarter.
state farm mutual automobile insurance co. said its state fire & casualty co. unit estimates claim payments from hugo will exceed $400 million in south carolina alone, far surpassing the company's record payout for a single disaster.
when damages in north carolina and virginia are added, the company said, the payments will exceed $500 million.
it said that is more than three times the previous record of $165 million set by hurricane alicia, which hit the houston-galveston, texas, area in 1983.
