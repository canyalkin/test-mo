international: robert maxwell plans to sell 45% to 49% of his mirror group 
mirror's flagship publication is the tabloid daily mirror, with sales of three million copies daily.
last month, in another money-raising move, mr.
maxwell's maxwell communication corp.
sold its pergamon press plc unit for #440 million.
in other changes, mr.
maxwell's son ian, who has been appointed deputy chairman of mirror group, will resign from his post at maxwell communication, where he was joint deputy managing director.
maxwell communication said last month that its management would be taken over by kevin maxwell, ian's brother.
robert maxwell bought mirror group in 1984 from reed international plc for #113 million.
through staff cuts and heavy spending on printing facilities, mr.
maxwell built mirror into one of britain's most profitable newspaper groups.
in 1990, mirror had profit of #37.2 million, or 28.2 pence a share, on revenue of #445 million.
proceeds from the share flotation will be used to strengthen and refinance the group's balance sheet.
about #210 million will be used to pay back bank loans and the rest to pay in full a loan from robert maxwell holdings ltd.

international is underwriting the international part of the offering, covering approximately one-third of the shares on sale, to be privately placed with institutional investors in the u.s., canada and europe.
the other two-thirds of the shares are to be divided between private and institutional investors in britain.
a relatively low minimum-investment figure of #250 has been set to attract small investors, particularly readers of mirror publications.
