ft  29 feb 92 / troops to pull out of nagorno karabakh
troops of the former soviet union were ordered to pull out from the armenian enclave of nagorno-karabakh yesterday after they were fired on during clashes between azeri and armenian militants.
marshal yevgeny shaposhnikov, the commonwealth of independent states' defence minister, announced the decision as fighting worsened in the disputed territory in spite of efforts to secure a truce.
the enclave is administered by azerbaijan but largely populated by armenians.
the order for the pull-out of the 366th motorised regiment follows the deaths earlier this week of a handful of soldiers caught in the fighting between armenian guerrillas and azerbaijani forces.
fighting flared again yesterday in the capital stepanakert, where the regiment is based.
azerbaijani and armenian officials claimed their civilian targets were under particularly vicious attack.
marshal shaposhnikov, who is also commander-in-chief, has long warned that he would withdraw troops rather than allow them to become targets of ethnic conflicts in the former soviet union.
no dates have been given for the withdrawal.
troops under fire along the armenian-azerbaijani border will also be withdrawn.
commanders of the trans-caucasus military district, which encompasses georgia as well as armenia and azerbaijan, have been ordered to rebuff attacks on military installations.
azeri and armenian officials say sophisticated weapons, including combat helicopters, tanks and armoured personnel carriers, are being used by guerrillas on both sides in the four-year-old conflict.
armenian militants attacked the last azeri stronghold in nagorno-karabakh yesterday, according to azerbaijan's interior ministry, which said residents of the town of shusha fled as helicopter gunships swooped down from snow-covered mountains.
armenians in the enclave want unification with armenia, but azerbaijan will not give up any territory.
