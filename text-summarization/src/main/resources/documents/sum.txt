the eyepiece used by astronomer edwin hubble from the mount wilson observatory's 100-inch hooker telescope, once the world's most powerful, was carried into orbit by the shuttle that launched the space telescope honoring him, a symbolic gesture from astronomy's past to its future.
using the hooker telescope, hubble was the first to determine the distance to a galaxy outside the milky way.
this provided evidence for the concept that the universe is expanding.
his work helped convince scientists that the universe was created in a giant explosion, called the "big bang".
the hooker telescope was mothballed in 1985.
