tuesday's earthquake, the strongest on the san andreas fault since the 1906 san francisco quake, came in a place scientists identified in 1988 as the most likely in northern california within the next 30 years.
the 1988 report cited probabilities for major temblors along the san andreas in central and southern california, but pinpointed the santa cruz mountains as the most vulnerable partly because the area marked the southernmost point of maximum ground slippage during the 1906 earthquake.
pressure was probably building up in the neighboring southern segment of the san andreas, which had not slipped as much since 1906.
