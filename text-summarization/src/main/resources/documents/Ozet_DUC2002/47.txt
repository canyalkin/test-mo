checkpoint charlie, the allied border crossing by the berlin wall, will be hauled away friday.
a huge crane hangs over the guardhouse where a sign in english, german, russian, and french says, "you are now leaving the american sector".
u.s. secretary of state baker, soviet foreign minister shevardnadze and the foreign ministers from france, britain, and the two germanys will preside over a ceremonial removal of the checkpoint friday.
the statesmen were in east berlin to discuss german unification.
the u.s. decided two weeks ago, with huge sections of the wall being ripped down daily, that it was a good time to remove the landmark.
