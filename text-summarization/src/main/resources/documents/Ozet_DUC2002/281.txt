a ferry sank six miles of the egyptian coast after ramming into a coral reef in stormy seas.
four hundred seventy one people are missing in shark invested red sea waters and investigators are looking into complaints from some of the 178 survivors that crewmembers abandoned ship without helping them.
the ferry was nearing the end of a trip from jiddah, saudi arabia and many of the passengers were returning from off season pilgrimages to mecca.
the ferry inexplicably left standard navigational channels and investigators were looking into the course change.
they also want to determine if the ferry was carrying enough lifeboats.
