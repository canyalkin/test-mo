nepalese police have bulldozed more than 50 brick and mud houses that have been made unstable by an earthquake that struck near the Ä±ndia-nepal border and killed at least 749 people.
police said they will continue demolishing houses until satisfied that those remaining are safe to live in. most homeless have moved in with neighbors or found shelter in tents while waiting to hear from the government about compensation or new homes.
prime minister shrestha while visiting nepal's hardest hit town, dharan, on tuesday said, "this is the biggest calamity to strike nepal".
the quake registered 6.5 on the richter scale.
