Ä±n the wake of tuesday's earthquake many san francisco-area homeowners will pay for damage out-of-pocket while insurance companies may actually benefit from the quake.
only 25-30 percent of area homeowners carry earthquake insurance.
of the estimated $500 million in residential damage, between $100 million and $150 million is insured.
the insurance companies, after three years of declining rates, are likely to win rate hikes from state regulators to compensate for the combined losses from the earthquake and hurricane hugo which hit the southeastern united states earlier this month.
thus, disappointing earnings in the fourth quarter may be followed by greater profitability in the long run.
