an arab league council meeting of foreign ministers was convened in cairo at kuwait's request.
the council failed to publicly condemn ıraq's invasion of kuwait.
so far, only lebanon's prime minister and foreign minister, salim hoss, has joined kuwait to publicly condemn this invasion--the first time in modern history one arab country invaded another to take control of the government.
ıraq claims it entered kuwait at the request of a kuwaiti revolutionary group that had overthrown the government.
kuwait has invoked the 1950 arab joint defense pact, which requires pact members "to repel [invader] aggression and restore security and peace."
