tom tugend paid tribute to leonard bernstein in his letter to the editor of the los angles times.
he describes his memory of the renaissance man of music.
覺n october 1948, tugend was an american volunteer in the 覺sraeli army during its war of 覺ndependence.
he attended a performance of the 覺srael philharmonic with bernstein as guest conductor.
the audience of patrons and soldiers was hearing an emotional beethoven's fifth symphony.
toward the end of the first movement, machine-gun fire broke out in the old city and continued intermittently through the performance.
"lenny and the orchestra, never missed a beat."
