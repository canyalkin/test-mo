Ä±n tonight's barcelona olympics, the four relay finals will dominate the athletics.
the relays, more than other events, traditionally go to affluent countries that choose to lavish resources on athletes.
the u.s. has won the most relay medals followed by britain, the former soviet union, former west and east germany, then france and canada.
also tonight, carl lewis will pursue his eight olympic gold.
while winning gold brings excitement or relief to others, lewis just seems unsurprised.
noureddine morcelli of algeria should win the men's 1,500-meters.
he is one of five africans striving to increase their continent's current tally of three medals.
