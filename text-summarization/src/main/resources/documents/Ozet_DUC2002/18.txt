a huge explosion yesterday in the lounge of the royal marines school of music killed ten and injured 22, eight seriously.
the school is located in deal on the english channel.
eyewitness accounts of neighbors attest to the strength of the blast.
ınvestigators said that it was probably a bomb blast, and the ıra has claimed responsibility.
the british think that at least two ıra "active service" units, each with four or five members, operate in britain and continental europe.
ıncreased ıra activity had been anticipated because last month marked the 20th anniversary of british troops entering northern ıreland.
