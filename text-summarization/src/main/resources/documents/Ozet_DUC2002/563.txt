john major, it seems, can be all things to all people.
recently, when asked how he had so much empathy with agriculture, major told an interviewer for farm weekly that his father had been a farmer in 1910; 33 years before major was born.
major also told an american audience in pittsburgh that his father had worked there is a steel worker.
wanting to be all things to all people he can appeal to the pro-europeans by saying he wants britain to be at the heart of europe while at the same time insulting the european commission when appealing to an audience of euro-skeptics.
