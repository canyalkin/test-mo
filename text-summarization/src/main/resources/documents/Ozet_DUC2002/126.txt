queen elizabeth awarded former prime minister margaret thatcher the order of merit on friday.
the award follows quickly on the heels of mrs.
thatcher's resignation as prime minister.
the quickness of the award suggests that the queen wished to show that there was no animosity between the two women.
at the same time, mrs.
thatcher's husband, denis, was awarded the hereditary knighthood of baronet.
he will be formally addressed as sir denis and his wife as lady thatcher, although she insists she wishes to be known simply as mrs.
thatcher. the order of merit, created in 1902, is restricted to only 24 men and women.
