on 16 may 1994 the tajik communist party called for the restoration of a rejuvenated soviet union in the form of a federation as the only way to restore order, and said a majority of tajiks supported the call.
the communist party leader said that the disintegration of the soviet union had led to economic and political chaos in all the republics.
last saturday supporters of the restoration movement held a funding congress in dushanbe, capital of tajikistan.
ethnic conflicts have disrupted many republics, but tajikistan was hit the hardest, with 100,00 killed.
