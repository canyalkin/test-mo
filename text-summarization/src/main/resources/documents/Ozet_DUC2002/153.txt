hurricane gilbert weakened to a tropical storm today along the texas-mexico border.
earlier this week, it left at least 109 people dead and 800,000 homeless throughout the caribbean and parts of mexico.
the more fortunate gulf coast residents expressed relief even though it sparked dozens of tornadoes that caused one death and some injuries and property damage.
evacuees are anxious to get home, but officials still warn of dangerous flash flooding while the storm moves along as a "huge rain-making machine".
Ä±t should now track up the mississippi river valley to end up in the great lakes as nothing more than foul weather.
