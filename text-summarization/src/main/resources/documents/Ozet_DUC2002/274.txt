the ferry accident was said to be Ä±ndia's worst ever.
the ferry was overloaded with people and wheat and lacked life jackets.
authorities believed at least 300 people on the lower deck died and about 100 swam to safety.
the boat sank a short time after it sailed about 100 yards from shore.
the boat trip is normally used by pilgrims crossing the river to worship at a hindu shrine.
