two weeks of tension culminated thursday before dawn with the 覺raqi invasion of kuwait.
the tension commenced when 覺raq massed troops on the kuwaiti border in a dispute over an oil field and kuwait's violation of opec oil quotas.
on wednesday 覺raqi officials abruptly walked out of diplomatic talks in jiddah, saudi arabia, and the next morning kuwait was invaded.
the bush administration demanded immediate withdrawal of the 覺raqi forces and announced that it was considering all options in its response.
u.s. warships have been on alert 600 miles to the southeast since july 24.
the u.n. security council called an emergency meeting for thursday.
