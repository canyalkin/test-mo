the senate panel considering john tower's nomination as secretary of defense has found discrepancies in his dealings with defense contractors.
the panel members cited differences in his testimony before the group and what he wrote in a deposition given at the time of his divorce from his second wife in 1987.
tower had told the panel that he only represented british aerospace, ınc.
on matters of civil aviation.
ın the deposition, however, he wrote that he had given the company advice on selling certain systems to the defense department.
the panel also is concerned about tower's drinking habits and reports of womanizing.
