senator john warner of virginia, who served in the senate with dan quayle said that when he heard the vp nominee speak, he thought him to be the next thomas jefferson.
former president ford compared quayle to president kennedy.
quayle's reaction to those comparisons is not known, but he has taken umbrage to earlier look alike comparisons with actor robert redford.
the actor has asked that quayle stop making those comparisons, but quayle said, they were made by the press and not by him.
eight fellow republican senators voiced their favorable feelings toward quayle.
