soviet president gorbachev after meeting with east german premier modrow on tuesday appeared to be more open toward eventual german reunification.
gorbachev's position appears similar to that adopted by the east german communists when they acknowledged unity as a long-term goal, but under no specific timetable.
gorbachev said unification decisions must include the four allied powers and take into account european opinions.
Ä±t now appears that unification is inevitable.
count otto lambsdorff, head of west germany's free democratic party, acknowledging gorbachev's "more positive attitude" urged "economic union" within 18 months as a prelude to full union of east and west germany.
