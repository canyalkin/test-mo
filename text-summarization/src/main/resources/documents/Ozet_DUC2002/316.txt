local authorities credit residents who showed respect for hurricane warnings for the low casualty rate from hurricane hugo.
charleston s.c. bore the brunt of hugo's fury, but only two of the state's 17 deaths were in the charleston area.
a local red cross official estimated that 18,000 residents of charleston and surrounding counties headed for shelters and tens of thousands motored inland.
charleston mayor riley said that those in shelters and those who evacuated inland "...were potential victims of injury and death".
north charleston mayor bourne credited people for heeding the warnings, saying "Ä±t was bad, but it could have been a lot worse."
