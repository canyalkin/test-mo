senators are under pressure to take a stand on supreme court nominee clarence thomas.
300 black pastors of the coalition for the restoration of the black family and society held a pro-thomas rally on the steps of the supreme court.
the citizens committee to confirm clarence thomas ran a television ad in four southern states where senators face re-election next year.
on the other side, senators are receiving the first of 500,000 anti-thomas postcards provided by the national abortion rights action league and the lawyers' committee for civil rights under law announced that 86 of about 110 members of its board of directors oppose thomas.
