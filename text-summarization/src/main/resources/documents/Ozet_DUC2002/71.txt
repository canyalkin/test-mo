former east german leader erich honecker and erich mielke, former head of the secret police, were interrogated by federal prosecutors about their role in killings of people who tried to flee the country.
more than 200 people were shot to death or killed by land mines as they tried to escape east germany's communist rule.
honecker, 77 and in failing health, has already been charged with corruption and abuse of power.
the murder charge could put honecker behind bars for life, but his poor health makes prosecution questionable.
he was toppled from power in october 1989 following pro-democracy protests.
