floods that hit guangdong, guangxi, hunan, jiangxi, fujian and zhejiang provinces have all receded.
caused by torrential rains in the xijiang and beijiang river valleys, the floods were the worst in 100 years.
the guangdong provincial government urged localities to help victims with food, clothing, shelter and medical care so that no one would die and no epidemic disease would break out.
the province has allocated grain, cash and farm production supplies such as fertilizer and diesel fuel to the flood-stricken areas.
central party member wen jiabao said the key to mitigating economic loss is to resume production as soon as possible.
