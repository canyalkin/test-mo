president bush named career diplomat deane hinton as ambassador to panama as a recess appointment since congress is not in session.
hinton, currently ambassador to costa rica, replaces arthur davis who had been recalled in protest of what the administration considered the stealing of the panamanian elections by general manuel noriega.
davis was later returned to panama after us forces invaded panama and guillermo endara was installed as president.
hinton has also been ambassador to el salvador and pakistan.
senate majority leader george mitchell called hinton highly qualified because of his "wide-ranging experience and expertise in central america".
