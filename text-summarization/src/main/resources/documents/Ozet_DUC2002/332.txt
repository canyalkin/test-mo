the hubble space telescope (hst) orbited with its lens cover open friday, but its electronics were shut down due to a malfunction.
hst's 10-foot aluminum aperture door was opened exposing its finely polished 94.5-inch mirror to starlight for the first time, but problems with its high-speed antennas will delay the release of its first test image which had been planned for tuesday.
scientific data will follow in a moth or two.
from its orbit high above the earth's distorting atmosphere hst will enable astronomers over its 15-year lifetime to look back 14 billion years and possibly determine the age of the universe.
