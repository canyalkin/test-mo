frustrated democrats on the senate judiciary committee complain that supreme court nominee clarence thomas is an evasive witness, but there has been no groundswell of opposition to his confirmation.
several senators were skeptical of thomas's insistence that he has no opinion on the 1973 supreme court decision legalizing abortion.
senators criticized thomas's tendency to back away from comments made in past speeches or articles giving, as one put it, the "appearance of a confirmation conversion".
5 of the 14 committee members, all republicans, appear solidly for thomas, probably 6 democrats are opposed, and three swing votes, one republican, two democrats, could go either way.
