the disappointment and anger following the acquittal of raymond buckey and his mother peggy mcmartin buckey on 52 charges of child molestation, is reflected in the words "ray must die" scrawled on the mcmartin pre-school.
although the jury deadlocked on the remaining 13 charges, some expressed the wish that prosecutors not retry the buckeys on these counts, saying it would only be the same circus.
most parents of children involved in the case expressed disappointment with the legal system, citing the defense for prolonging the case and the prosecution for not doing enough research to prosecute the case properly.
