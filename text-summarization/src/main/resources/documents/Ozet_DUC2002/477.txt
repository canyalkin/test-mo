sir robert clark, chairman of mirror group newspapers, in a statement issued released yesterday lists a number of unusual payments for mgn.
the transactions, involved mr.
michael stoney, a senior executive in a number of maxwell companies, as well as kevin and ıan maxwell, two sons of the late robert maxwell.
although sir robert stresses that the transactions may have been legitimate, he says legal actions may be taken against a number of organizations, ıncluding goldman sachs, the u.s. investment bank.
at issue is whether the bank was aware than more than pounds 40m in transfers from mgn were effected for improper purposes.
