leonard bernstein returned to carnegie hall with the new york philharmonic on monday, exactly 45 years after his triumphant conducting debut.
he first conducted here as an emergency fill-in with no rehearsal.
that concert was nationally broadcast and catapulted bernstein to fame at age 25.
the shimmering performance, the 1,215th time he conducted this orchestra, consisted of three bernstein compositions--"chichester psalms", a serenade, and a symphony.
performers from his first concert attended on monday night, including a violinist who played on both occasions.
bernstein had celebrated his 70th birthday this summer at tanglewood and asked on monday, "will this birthday never end?"
