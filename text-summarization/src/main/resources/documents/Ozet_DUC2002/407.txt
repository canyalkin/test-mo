the large majority of the authorities in moldavia are ethnic romanians.
the cease-fire between them and the russian-speaking minority was short-lived.
most of the ethnic russians live east of the dnestr river and a shooting there broke the cease-fire.
russians and ukrainians account for 27 percent, and moldavians make up 64 percent of the small republic's population of four and a half million.
the dispute started in 1989 as a language movement as moldavia wanted to express their common ethnicity with romania.
this is a dispute that arose out of the soviet union's demise.
