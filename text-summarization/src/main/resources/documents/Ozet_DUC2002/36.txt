the 1989 publication of the forbes listing of the richest people again has sam walton as the nation's richest man.
he has been on top since forbes first published the listing in 1988.
this year he is in the list of the wealthiest in the world.
the annual forbes publication makes walton uncomfortable.
he shuns the personal publicity that goes with his status, preferring to concentrate on wal-mart and pursue the simple life on bentonville, arkansas.
he calls his salespeople "associates", and frequently visits them at one of the stores.
