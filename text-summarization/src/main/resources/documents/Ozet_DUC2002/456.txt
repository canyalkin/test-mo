覺raq says it invaded kuwait at the request of a revolutionary organization there, but diplomats worldwide dismiss this rational as a large-scale charade.
the u.n. security council voted 14-0 to condemn the invasion.
覺raq's u.n. representative said the u.n. should not be involved, the fall of kuwait was an internal matter.
meanwhile, a series of communiques from the "provisional government", whose members were not identified, came from the 覺raqi state-run news agency in baghdad, not from kuwait, indicating that the 覺raqis are in charge.
kuwait is one of the few arab states that has experimented with a freely elected parliament.
