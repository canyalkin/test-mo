the mcmartin pre-school case appears to be headed for television and the bookshelf.
at least one screenwriter, abby mann, has been working on a retelling of the 6-year-old case almost from the beginning.
after gaining the confidence of the defendants, mann, along with his wife myra and former prosecutor glenn stevenson, were hired as investigators by the defense.
an 800 page manuscript also is in the works for random house.
some television producers expressed reservations about accepting a film about the mcmartin trial, citing possible legal problems since 13 of the charges remain open in the case.
