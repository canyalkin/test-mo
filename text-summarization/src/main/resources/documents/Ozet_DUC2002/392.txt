chinese troops stormed tiananmen square early sunday, shooting and beating their way through crowds of pro-democracy protesters.
the assault came two weeks after premier li peng declared martial law in beijing.
sporadic clashes were reported on saturday as soldiers made several attempts to reach the square.
they retreated temporarily under a barrage of rocks and other objects but resumed their push more violently at about 8 p.m. firing weapons and using tear gas as they moved toward tiananmen.
by 3:30 a.m. sunday troops had surrounded the square.
at 4:30 armored personnel carriers entered the square and began slowly moving toward the several thousand students who remained.
