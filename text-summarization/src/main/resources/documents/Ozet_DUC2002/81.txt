william wegman is a professional photographer known for hilarious portraits of his weimaraner dogs.
they are good companions for an artist.
they are affectionate, do not drool and they have style.
his current weimaraners, fay ray and battina, are like world- famous fashion models--they are lean and supple.
william's relationship with them is unusually tender.
Ä±t is easy to see how he can get them to slip into florid housedresses or scratch each other's backs.
william's first world famous dog, man ray, died in 1985.
fay ray is now familiar to artists and among children who watch "sesame street".
