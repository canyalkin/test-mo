the hubble space telescope (hst) has arrived seven years late where it belongs: aboard the shuttle discovery orbiting 380 miles above earth.
Ä±t was supposed to be launched in 1983, but technical problems and the challenger accident delayed its deployment.
the telescope has two mirrors, two cameras, two spectrometers, a photometer, and a fine pointing system providing precise measurement of distances.
on wednesday a discovery astronaut will operate the shuttle's mechanical arm to lift the 12-ton hst out of the cargo bay and drop it overboard to orbit on its own.
scientists have hailed the hst as the greatest advance in astronomy since galileo.
