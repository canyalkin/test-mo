according to the state flood control and drought relief headquarters, after the largest or the second largest flood peaks since the liberation of china occurred a few days ago in the xi jiang, bei jiang, xiang jiang, and gan jiang rivers, water levels in these rivers are dropping slowly.
however, this does not mean that guangdong's flooding has eased.
the sea tide may add to the floodwater causing the zhujiang delta with its forest of factories to face its most rigorous flood test yet.
the situation in xiang jiang is also stabilized.
dike reinforcing work needs to be done.
