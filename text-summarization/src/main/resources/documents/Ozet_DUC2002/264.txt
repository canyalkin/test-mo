the earthquake that hit ıran early thursday exacted particularly large casualties because people were asleep in fragile homes built on a flood plain of loosely deposited soil that shifts in an earthquake.
the quake that measured 7.7 on the richter scale hit a mountainous section of coastal ıran at 12:30 a.m. and was the most powerful ever recorded in the area where two major plates of the earth's crust meet.
most structures in the area are built of a ceramic-type brick or adobe that collapses easily.
at least 25,000 died and thousands were injured.
thousands were buried in the rubble of their homes.
