margaret thatcher barely survived a vote of confidence by her party colleagues in the house of commons.
the narrow margin of her victory over former defense minister michael heseltine means thatcher will face a second round of voting on thursday.
mrs. thatcher has served longer than any other prime minister in this century, steering her country through a war with argentina and reversing britain's economic decline.
even so, after 11.5 years, the negative aspects of mrs.
thatcher's tenure are likely to overshadow her accomplishments and her re-election is hardly assured as polls indicate the tories would do better without her in the next election.
