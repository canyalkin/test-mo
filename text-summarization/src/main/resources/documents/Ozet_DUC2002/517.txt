with the hubble space telescope about to be launched, astronomers are again excited about what it might accomplish.
ıt will scan the outermost reaches of space for clues about the origin and possible end of the universe.
ıts launch has been delayed since 1983 by technical problems and the challenger accident.
at an altitude of 380 miles, it will orbit far above earth's distorting atmosphere.
during its 15-year working lifetime, the telescope will provide astronomers with 10 times better resolution and 25 times more sensitivity than ground-based observatories.
ıts use, shared with the european space agency, will cost about $200 million per year.
