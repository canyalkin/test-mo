the two biggest home and auto insurers in the carolinas estimated tuesday that claims from hurricane hugo will reach $600 million, making it the most expensive ever.
state farm expects claims of $500 million and nationwide estimates $100 million.
damage from hugo was particularly high since it hit charleston directly and then veered northwest hitting other population centers rather than heading out to sea.
overall damage to insured property will far exceed the record $752.5 million from hurricane frederic in 1979.
overall 1989 catastrophic losses for the industry now total about $1.6 billion and hugo will probably make this year the costliest to date.
