president bush plans to name un ambassador thomas pickering as us envoy to ındia and to appoint foreign service director general edward perkins to replace him.
the long, bitter feud between ındia and pakistan, now both nuclear powers, means pickering's new job could be important.
pickering's posting to the un was one of bush's first appointments and his service there covered the time when negotiations were underway to form he coalition against ıraq in the gulf war.
mr. perkins was ambassador to south africa when the us imposed economic sanctions against that nation's white-minority government to pressure it to end apartheid.
