bill mcfadden, a 32-year-old professional dog handler, knows that the secret to producing champions is just plain, hard work.
bill, assisted by his wife taffe, puts in 18 hour days grooming and conditioning his charges, and then crisscrosses the country showing them for their owners.
mcfadden handles an average of 20 to 25 dogs at each show and works around 120 shows a year throughout the u.s.
"we finish with close to 100 champions a year," he said.
mcfadden's latest product, a kerry blue terrier named kerrageen's hotspur with 37 best in show wins, is the top in his breed of all time.
