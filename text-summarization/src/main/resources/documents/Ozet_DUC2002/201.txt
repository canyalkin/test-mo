a 7-member team of navy investigators, including former battleship commander rear adm.
milligan and gunnery experts, will look at possible human or mechanical errors as causes of the explosion aboard the battleship Ä±owa that killed 47.
the investigation will be complex because there were no witnesses.
the explosion damaged only the inside of the turret.
the gun's breech was open and undamaged with the projectile still present, indicating the explosion occurred while powder was being transferred from a powder hoist to the gun.
flame and hot gases reached the lowest deck, indicating the hoist was not yet sealed.
a video of the blast was released sunday.
