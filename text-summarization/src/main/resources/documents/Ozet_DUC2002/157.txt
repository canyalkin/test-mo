anger greeted thursday's acquittals in the mcmartin pre-school molestation case.
while the defense claimed a triumph of justice over hysteria and hype, irate parents blamed the prosecution of being inept.
jurors found raymond buckey and his mother, peggy mcmartin buckey, innocent of 52 charges against them.
no verdict was reached on 13 other charges and prosecutors must decide if they wish to call a new trial on those charges.
jurors, while admitting that some of the children may have been molested, stated that it did not mean they were molested at the mcmartins school.
the case was the longest and costliest in u.s. history.
