the 1988 summer olympics may well be remembered for the glory enjoyed by u.s. diver greg louganis and the disgrace experienced by canadian sprinter ben johnson.
louganis won his second pair of gold medals after striking his on a springboard, which opened a cut requiring five stitches.
johnson had his gold medal and world record stripped because of drug use.
olympic officials believe that catching johnson and nine other athletes with positive drug tests indicates that we will successful stop "doping".
surprisingly, the soviets apparently won the hearts and cheers of the host south koreans, while u.s. athletes experienced some anti-u.s. sentiment.
