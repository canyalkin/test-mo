former senator john tower, president bush's nominee as defense secretary under went surgery to remove a colon polyp on thursday.
senator tower was listed in fair condition following the surgery and is expected to make a full recovery.
tower entered the hospital on wednesday after a colonoscopy revealed the polyp.
a preliminary biopsy of the polyp, which was removed during a three hour surgery, showed it to be benign.
a rectal polyp was removed during the colonoscopy which showed malignant but well differentiated cells.
an announcement on the first polyp was to come from tower's surgeon on thursday.
