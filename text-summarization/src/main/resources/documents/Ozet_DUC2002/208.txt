the national hurricane center provided life-saving information as hurricane hugo moved across the caribbean toward the carolinas.
forecasters, with the aid of satellites and computers, calculated where the hurricane would strike so that emergency operations could get underway in those areas.
the center personnel felt the word did not get out in the caribbean, but were reassured by the response in the carolinas where proper response probably saved hundreds or thousands of lives.
by the time hugo hit charleston the center's big job was done.
early today there were no immediate reports of deaths despite widespread damage in charleston and coastal south carolina.
