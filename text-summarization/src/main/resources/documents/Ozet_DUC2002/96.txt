mount pinatubo erupted sunday, the first eruption in over 600 years, shooting out gases, rock and ash.
eruptions continued today, leaving the mountain enshrouded in thick gray clouds that rose to 12,000 feet.
Ä±t had recently shown signs of activity, and philippine scientists now say a catastrophe is possible.
rain last night raised the additional fear of mudslides.
clark air force base, one of the largest u.s. installations overseas, is ten miles from the mountain.
most airmen, dependents and civilian employees were evacuated to the u.s. naval base at subic bay, 50 miles from clark.
