experience of a reporter at candlestick park for the world series the night of the 1989 san francisco quake: ı was sitting in a trailer outside the stadium when the earthquake hit.
ı looked out and the stadium was shaking.
a special concrete joint on top of the stadium was opening and closing like cardboard.
a few people were running out.
ı walked into the stadium to interview fans and sensed little panic.
most people stayed, waiting to hear whether the game would be postponed.
when leaving, those in the upper deck seemed more shaken that those in lower levels.
