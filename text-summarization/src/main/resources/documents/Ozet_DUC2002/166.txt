rev. eales is a victim of the mcmartin trial.
although neither the church nor any of its officials, including eales, were ever formally charged, the church was subject to repeated vandalism and threats over the years because of the 1985 claim of a former mcmartin's student who claimed he had witnessed satanic rituals and animal sacrifices at the church.
even though the charges were never substantiated, the threats and vandalism continued.
