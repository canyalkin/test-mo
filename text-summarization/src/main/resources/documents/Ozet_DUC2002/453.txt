the u.n. security council demanded that 覺raq unconditionally withdraw its invasion forces from kuwait.
覺raq's u.n. representative said they would withdraw when the "free kuwaiti interim government' of "revolutionary youth" who toppled the kuwaiti government, and to whose aid they came, requested it.
覺raq said this was an internal, not a u.n. matter.
the kuwaiti ambassador to the u.n. said this was "a false, flimsy pretext" and if not deterred in a decisive manner, all international relations will be threatened.
the u.s. declared that it stands with kuwait.
kuwait wants its negotiations with 覺raq mediated by the arab league.
