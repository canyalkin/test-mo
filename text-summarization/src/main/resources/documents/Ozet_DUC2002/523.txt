countdown resumed saturday for the shuttle discovery's delayed launch on tuesday to boost the $1.5 billion hubble space telescope into orbit.
the new tuesday launch day is 14 days after the flight was grounded just four minutes before takeoff by a faulty hydraulic power steering unit.
the replacement power unit was successfully test fired and the telescope's battery charging was completed one day ahead of schedule.
a nasa spokesman said they were 80% go for launch weather-wise.
with discovery on track, engineers readied the shuttle columbia for rollout to its launch pad for its may 16 spacelab astronomy mission.
