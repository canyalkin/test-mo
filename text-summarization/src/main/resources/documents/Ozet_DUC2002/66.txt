former east german leader, erich honecker, may be moved to a monastery to protect him from a possible lynching by enraged citizens.
he is under investigation for corruption and living in luxury at the cost of the state.
he was placed under house arrest in december 1989.
both lutheran and catholic churches have offered honecker refuge.
Ä±t was the churches that became venues for pro-democracy groups that eventually brought the overthrow of honecker's 18 year leadership.
recently, east german groups have called for punishing honecker and moving him to smaller quarters.
the current leadership fears that in such a situation, honecker might be attacked.
