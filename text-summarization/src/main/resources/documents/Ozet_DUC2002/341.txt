more than 18,000 runners are expected to run in the 1987 los angeles marathon.
other marathons have had corporate backing, but los angeles is out in front in making a marathon into a commercial spectacle.
makers of cars, cameras, soft drinks, banks, and even a hospital have signed on as sponsors in los angeles.
the city has given the promoters an eight-year operating contract.
unlike most marathons, los angeles does not pay appearance money to the better runners.
last year the marathon grossed four million dollars.
this year promoters expect to gross five million, and break even for the first time.
