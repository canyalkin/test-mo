soviet foreign minister shevardnadze proposed today that a united germany be allowed to join nato after a five-year period during which all soviet and u.s. troops would leave the country.
u.s. secretary of state baker responded, "Ä± am underwhelmed".
the united states objects to the 5-year waiting period while the soviet union has opposed a united germany's membership in nato.
shevardnadze also remarked at a ceremony for the removal of checkpoint charlie that all western troops should be removed from "greater berlin" within six months after unification, a provision which apparently would also apply to soviet troops just outside the city proper.
