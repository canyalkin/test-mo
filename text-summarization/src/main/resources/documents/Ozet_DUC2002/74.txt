a ranking member of chairman's helmut kohl's party demanded that the soviet union turn over erich honecker, who is wanted by german authorities on manslaughter charges.
a berlin court has issued an arrest warrant for honecker, 78, for issuing shoot- to-kill orders to east german guards at the now-fallen berlin wall.
honecker has denied all charges against him, including that he was responsible for the estimated 200 people who died trying to escape east germany.
honecker's fate is one of the first issues facing bonn and moscow since they signed several treaties designed to draw the two nations closer.
