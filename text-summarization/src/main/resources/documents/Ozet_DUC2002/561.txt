just a year after winning the general election, a surprise to everyone, mr.
john major enters the second year of his term as a deeply unpopular leader.
the honeymoon following his victory was short lived and his past year has been marked by a number of controversies.
these controversies include internal party differences over europe, the debacle surrounding britain's withdrawal from the exchange rates mechanism of the european monetary system, as well as a deep and continuing recession.
the recession has alienated many of his allies in the business community.
major is seen as a weak leader without a clear political agenda.
