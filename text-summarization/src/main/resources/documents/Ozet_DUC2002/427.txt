the drought and high temperatures continue to plague sections of the united states.
ın an effort to stave off the worst effects of the drought, farmers in oregon shipped 20 tons of hay to kentucky and other states were compiling information on where hay might be available.
ın other areas, the alabama national guard continued to supply water to 10 communities.
even though the state has had rain, it is not enough to counteract the effects of the drought.
parts of the upper midwest also have received rain, but at least 10 inches more are need to return the water table to normal levels.
