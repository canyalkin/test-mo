on monday clarence thomas completed five days of questioning by the senate judiciary committees and appeared to be well on his way to confirmation.
speculation is that the committee will recommend confirmation by a 10-4 or 9-5 vote.
several liberal democrats accused thomas of being evasive and of disavowing controversial statements he had made as an advocate of the bush and reagan administrations.
the american bar association evaluation committee testified that although thomas' articles in law journals were deficient in presentation, scholarship and analysis, this is outweighed by his "brief but highly satisfactory performance on the court of appeals."
