mcdonald's will open its first outlets in korea through a 50-50 joint venture, mcahn Ä±ndustries lltd.
, founded with harvard trained accountant-turned-entrepreneur, mr.
ahn hyo young.
mcahn struggled to overcome government red tape and to find reliable local produce suppliers.
starting modestly, their strategy is to open three outlets this year and five each year thereafter.
south korea has asia's fastest growing economy.
mcahn's hope is to develop mcdonald's image as an affordable place for the korean middle class rather than a familiar name for foreigners.
attention will be given to attracting children.
currently they face competition from wendy's, burger king and homegrown burger chains.
