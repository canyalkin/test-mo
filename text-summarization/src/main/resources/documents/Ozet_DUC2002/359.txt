soviet president mikhail gorbachev was back in power and returning to moscow as the collapsed coup leaders fled.
tanks used in the takeover attempt were leaving the capital.
president bush said he spoke to gorbachev and that the soviet leader was again "calling the shots".
the post-coup crackdown fell most heavily on the independence-minded baltic states where latvia and estonia had declared independence for the soviet union.
boris yeltsin supported gorbachev during the coup but the two men have different approaches to soviet reforms.
gorbachev's foreign minister promised that reforms would continue and moscow would honor its international commitments.
