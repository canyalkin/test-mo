ousted east german leader erich honecker was arrested and taken to prison today and a prosecutor said he will be tried for high treason in march.
honecker was detained after his release from hospital, where he had undergone surgery for a malignant kidney tumor.
the charge of high treason carries a maximum life imprisonment.
east germany has been caught up in a virtual frenzy to root out corruption and abuse of office since honecker's ouster in october.
eleven members of honecker's ousted politburo already are in prison awaiting trial, however his doctor repeated that honecker is still not well enough to be jailed.
