this morning new york city's chinatown responded to events in beijing.
more than 5,000 people chanting, "freedom will survive"! packed a chinatown park in a memorial service for students killed by soldiers in tiananmen square.
the crowd stood respectfully and silently during a traditional funeral ceremony and then marched through the streets in a funeral procession waving banners honoring "the martyrs of tiananmen square".
as they headed up mulberry street, a major street in chinatown, they walked beneath a 30-foot black banner.
demonstrators planned another rally later in the day outside the united nations.
