six hours after a failed attempt, ground controllers re-established contact thursday with the hubble space telescope (hst) through its main antennas.
controllers sent positional information to the telescope and widened the radio beam to cover a larger area around the two high-speed antennas.
space shuttle discovery trailed 57 miles behind the hst and was to stay nearby until the hubble's aperture door is opened friday morning.
Ä±f signals fail to open the door, astronauts will walk into space and crank it open saturday.
the shuttle, scheduled to return to earth on sunday, would extend its mission if the space walk is necessary.
