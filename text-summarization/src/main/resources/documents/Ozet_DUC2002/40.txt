a book entitled, "wal-mart: sam walton's retail phenomenon" was published two years after walton died.
ıt was advertised as a "scholarly account" of wal-mart's success.
the chain's rise was spectacular.
the company did not incorporate until 1971 when it had only 38 outlets and was not listed among the country's top 71 discounters.
ıts turnover was nine percent of sears' and 11 percent of k-mart's.
ten years later its sales surpassed both.
walton studied the competition and adapted from them.
another strength was its openness to technology.
an example was its 20 million dollar investment in an internal satellite system.
