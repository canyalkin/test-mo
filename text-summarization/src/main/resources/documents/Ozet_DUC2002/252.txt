president corazon aquino said friday that she would not permit ousted leader ferdinand marcos to be buried in the philippines.
he is near death in hawaii, where he has been in exile.
his wife, Ä±melda, is maintaining a vigil and appealing for his return.
aquino said she is praying for his recovery, but will not allow his remains to be returned.
although marco is accused of looting the nation's treasury and is under u.s. indictment, he still has supporters in the philippines.
they are accused of at least three coup attempts and now are planning a demonstration for sunday.
