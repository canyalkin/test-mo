julia baird, former beatle john lennon's half-sister, has written a memoir about lennon's younger years.
baird wrote the book in response to the portrayal of john lennon as moody neglected child.
baird feels that their mother has been maligned and decided to write the book after seeing a television show that presented her mother as an "unfit mother, no mother at all".
baird was born seven years after lennon and she and her sister grew up with their parents amid an extended family, including brother john.
she writes that her mother and lennon had a loving relationship, even though living apart.
