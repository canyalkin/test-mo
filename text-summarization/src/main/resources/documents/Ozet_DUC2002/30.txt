republican vp candidate dan quayle's official resume incorrectly characterizes his service with the Ä±ndiana consumer protection division.
quayle has conceded that the resume entry was inaccurate and said that his staff had written the document.
the erroneous information had indicated that quayle was the chief investigator of the division a year before its creation.
a quayle spokesman called the revelation of the error by the plain dealer of cleveland "a cheap shot".
quayle also quit referring to himself as a "vietnam-era veteran" when objections came from some vietnam combat veterans.
