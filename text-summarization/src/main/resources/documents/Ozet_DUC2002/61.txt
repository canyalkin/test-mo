american historians agree that fears of a resurgent militaristic german state after reunification are baseless.
most believe that a politically and economically collapsing east germany represents a greater threat to world stability.
however, there is not agreement on how a unified germany will affect its european neighbors and soviet bloc countries.
a dominant german economy could slow or even reverse what has been emerging european economic integration.
furthermore, while most west europeans have gotten over nationalistic mistrusts, east europeans living in closed societies have not.
one historian urges caution.
reunification could prove explosive if mishandled.
west germans are aware of their neighbors' misgivings.
