Ä±t appears that olympic gold has lost much of its commercial luster.
following the 1984 olympics, pixie gymnast mary lou retton signed up for $5 million in commercial advertisements.
no one from the 1988 games will follow in her steps.
marketers say these medalists will pull in $100,000 to $500,000 a year.
why? reasons abound.
the games occurred halfway around the world, tv coverage was rated poor, no heroes - the soviets trounced u.s. competitors and drug scandals cast a pall over the games.
also, many advertisers now prefer athletes who are in the public eye longer, like football players or basketball's michael jordan.
