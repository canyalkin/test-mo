attempting to take advantage of weeks of hype, both companies will spend upwards of $7 million.
anheuser busch's "bud bowl 覺覺" ad campaign will feature animated teams of budweiser and bud light beer bottles rattling around on a pint-sized football field.
miller's 12-week pre-super bowl campaign will center on a football game between a "tastes great" team and a "less filling" squad featuring nfl players.
