john major was elected to succeed margaret thatcher as prime minister tuesday night by the conservative party.
major fell two votes short of a majority but his two opponents quickly conceded defeat and major was confirmed as the winner.
major succeeds following an initial challenge to party leadership by former defense secretary michael heseltine last week.
when it became apparent that she could not defeat the heseltine challenge, mrs.
thatcher resigned in order to let someone from the cabinet stand against heseltine.
major and foreign secretary douglas hurd both joined the race, a race in which thatcher endorsed major.
