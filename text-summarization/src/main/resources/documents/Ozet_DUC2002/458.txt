ıraq ended its eight-year war with ıran with an estimated $70 billion debt.
these war bills keep the government from delivering promised benefits to the ıraqi people.
ıraq also wishes for a longer gulf coastline.
recently saddam hussein accused kuwait of costing ıraq billions by overproducing oil, thus driving down its price, by stealing oil from a contested border field and by demanding repayment of war debts.
he seemed determined to solve his financial and territorial ambitions by conquering his neighbor.
ıraq has always refused to recognize kuwait's independence.
he could also use this invasion to browbeat other neighbors on local policy issues.
