hurricane andrew yesterday smashed its way through louisiana causing heavy damage in rural communities but missing low-lying new orleans.
after hitting louisiana with winds up to 120 miles per hour, andrew lost force and by yesterday afternoon was down-graded to a tropical storm.
early reports indicate one death, 75 injuries, and thousands homeless in louisiana after 14 deaths in florida and three in the bahamas.
across florida 2 million people were without electricity yesterday.
there was more than $15 billion property damage in florida, but most of it was to uninsured property, so insurers' losses are likely to total less than $1 billion.
