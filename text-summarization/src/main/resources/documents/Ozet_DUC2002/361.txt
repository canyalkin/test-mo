soviet president mikhail gorbachev said the failed power grab by hard-liners could prove to be an opportunity to further his democratic reforms.
he condemned the attempted takeover as being against "the people, against democracy".
he named a new acting kgb chief, new interior and defense ministers and said he would do everything to "drive out the reactionary forces from the communist party".
gorbachev said that he and yeltsin were brought together by the situation and he publicly praised yeltsin who had attained folk-hero status by rallying hundreds of thousands of his supporters to resist the coup.
