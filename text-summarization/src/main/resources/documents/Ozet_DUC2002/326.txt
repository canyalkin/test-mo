the long delayed launching of the hubble space telescope (hst) has evoked a burst of superlatives from the nation's scientists.
from james westphal at the california Ä±nstitute of technology we hear, "no one ever made anything that good".
edward weiler, the chief nasa scientist on the hst project declares, "on a clear, dark night you can see a flashlight from two miles away.
with a 28-power telescope you can see it on the moon 250,000 miles away.
with the hst you could see a firefly in australia from washington".
others hail hst as the greatest thing since galileo's telescope in 1609.
