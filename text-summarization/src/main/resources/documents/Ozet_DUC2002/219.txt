ıraqi president saddam hussein's occupation of kuwait reflects his need to escape from economic and social problems arising from the eight-year war with ıran.
saddam says he fought the war to protect sunni arabs from the fundamentalist shiite persian revolution in ıran and should not be expected to repay war debts to fellow sunni arabs.
by focusing on claimed misdeeds of kuwait he hopes to divert attention from the economic and social chaos reigning at home while gaining the wealth and territory represented by kuwait.
this is the first time that an arab state has deposed the government of a fellow arab league member.
