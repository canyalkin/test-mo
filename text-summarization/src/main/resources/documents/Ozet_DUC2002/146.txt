this year's academy awards ceremonies opened with an elaborate, 10-minute snow white song-and-dance routine, without disney's permission.
the academy of motion picture arts and sciences told disney only that the program contained no material deleterious to disney interests.
disney sued for copyright infringement when the academy refused to publicly apologize for unauthorized use of the disney character.
Ä±ronically, the academy closely protects the oscar's copyrighted name and image.
the snow white character portrayed wednesday night was created by steve silver, who has used the character in the san francisco musical revue "beach blanket babylon" for 15 years.
disney has never sued silver but didn't rule out the possibility.
