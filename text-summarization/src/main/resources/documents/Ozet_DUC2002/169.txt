more than 10,000 coal miners in kentucky, pennsylvania, Ä±ndiana and west virginia walked off the job to express sympathy for miners in virginia and west virginia, who have waged a bitter two-month strike against pittston coal group.
pittston dropped out of the bituminous coal operators association to negotiate with the union independently and the two sides have failed to reach an agreement despite 16 months of negotiations.
united mine workers officials gave conflicting indications of whether or not they are responsible for the wildcat strikes.
the coal companies contend that walkouts at any mines other than pittston, violate the contract with the union.
