turnout for a concert marking what would have been the 50th birthday of john lennon was disappointing.
organizers had hoped for 45,000 attendees, but only 15,000 came.
the concert featured a program of beatles and lennon songs.
ex-beatles did not attend, but paul mccartney and ringo starr made taped contributions.
proceeds of the concert will go to the spirit foundation, the charity founded by john lennon and his wife ono in 1978.
lennon was slain on december 8, 1980 at the age of 40.
mark chapman, the man who killed him is serving a life sentence.
