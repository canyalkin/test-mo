more than a dozen bombs exploded in bombay last night killing about 200 people and injuring more than a thousand in ındia's commercial heart.
the attack was a severe setback to ındia's attempts to recover from recent intercommunal violence sparked by razing of a mosque at ayodhya in northern ındia by hindu zealots on december 6.
ensuing riots killed more than 2,000 people, mostly moslems, including 700 in bombay.
last night's targets included the bombay stock exchange and the landmark air ındia building.
ıt was clearly aimed at the city's better-off business people whereas most of the victims of the riots were poor.
