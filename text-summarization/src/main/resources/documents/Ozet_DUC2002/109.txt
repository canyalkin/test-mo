a large study has shown that taking a single aspirin every other day could cut heart attack risk in half.
this was one of several reports that show doctors can prevent heart attacks as well as treat them.
doctor's also found that one aspirin and a single dose of clot dissolving given within 24 hours of heart attack dramatically cut the risk of a second fatal heart attack.
other researchers determined that some heart attack victims could be released from the hospital as soon as three days after their heart attacks.
after 6 months, not one death was reported in the early discharge group.
