west german chancellor helmut kohl declared on his return from meeting with president gorbachev in moscow that "the way is now free" for german unification.
kolh said that the east german march election has to come first, and then everything will go quickly.
west germany's social democratic party has a surprisingly strong, fledging branch in east germany.
Ä±f the two germanys unite before the west german election in december, the growing number of social democratic voters in what is today east germany--presuming they could vote in december--could easily tip the balance away from the christian democrats, pushing kohl out of government leadership.
