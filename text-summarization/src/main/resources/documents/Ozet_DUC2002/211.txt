hugo stormed through the eastern caribbean and the carolinas this past week with 135 mph winds, killing at least 41 people.
gilbert, the most powerful hurricane ever recorded with winds up to 180 mph, blasted the caribbean last year killing 300 and causing $2 billion damage.
scientists studying global warming say if the seas warm up by 3-6 degrees fahrenheit, the destructive force of hurricanes would increase by 50 percent.
the warming trend may already be here.
six of the 10 hottest years in the last century occurred in the 1980's.
