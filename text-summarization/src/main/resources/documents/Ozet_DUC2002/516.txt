on tuesday, a second attempt will be made to launch the shuttle discovery with the $1.5 billion hubble space telescope aboard.
a faulty power unit forced cancellation of the first attempt on april 10.
meanwhile, shuttle columbia is also being prepped to launch a satellite called astro.
this is only the second time both shuttle pads at kennedy space center have been occupied simultaneously.
discovery will aim to place the telescope in orbit at an altitude of 380 miles where astronomers hope it will be able to look back almost to the beginning of time.
columbia's astro will measure ultraviolet radiation.
