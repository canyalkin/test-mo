east germany's deposed communist leader erich honecker is too sick to be held in jail, but is fit enough to be tried.
honecker is still recovering from kidney cancer surgery and is not well enough to be incarcerated.
honecker 77, ruled east germany for 19 years until he was ousted in october 1989 as a wave of pro-democracy demonstrations led to a peaceful overthrow of the communist government.
honecker and seven others are charged with corruption and abuse of office.
the federal prosecutor said he plans to continue the investigation against the former east german leaders, despite their poor health.
