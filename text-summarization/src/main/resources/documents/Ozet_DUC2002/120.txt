former president reagan had nothing but praise for british prime minster margaret thatcher on the eve of her retirement.
the prime minister, dubbed the ıron lady, succumbed to the challenge mounted by her former defense minister, michael heseltine.
reagan and thatcher were staunch allies.
her support was especially valuable when mrs.
thatcher was the only ally who supported the u.s. bombing of libya and allowed u.s. bombers to fly from british bases.
reagan, in turn supported mrs.
thatcher during great britain's war with argentina over the falkland ıslands, choosing to side with one ally, great britain, against another ally, argentina.
