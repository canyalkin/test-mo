as punishment for not withdrawing its forces from kuwait, the u.n. security council voted to impose trade and military sanctions against 覺raq, including a ban on oil purchases.
覺t was only the third time in the u.n.'s 45-year existence that it voted sanctions against a member state.
the sanctions are legally binding for all member nations, although past resolutions have often been ignored or flouted.
earlier, the 覺raqi- installed military government of kuwait warned other nations to not take punishing measures against it or 覺raq, ominously saying that such countries "have to remember they have interests and citizens in kuwait."
