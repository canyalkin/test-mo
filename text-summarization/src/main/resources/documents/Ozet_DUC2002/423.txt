the world grain stock levels are expected to drop in the wake of the continued drought in the united states.
the grain stocks are projected to fall below 310 million tons, 17 percent of what is considered necessary to safeguard world food security.
as a result, many poorer countries could face a food shortage as grain prices rise.
the crops most affected are maize, barley and oats.
good harvests are expected in other parts of the world but in the sahel region of sub-saharan africa, damage from locust could cause crops losses of 1 million tons.
