yesterday, in response to the california earthquake, president bush and his aides flew into a whirlwind of activity that seemed designed to dispel any thought that the white house was not engaged.
after the exxon valdez oil spill and the devastation of hurricane hugo the administration was criticized for its slow response.
bush as much as admitted that the present flurry of activism was intended to counter such criticism, remarking during a visit to the federal emergency management agency that he hoped there would be "less carping" this time about the agency's performance.
the president may visit the earthquake site this weekend.
