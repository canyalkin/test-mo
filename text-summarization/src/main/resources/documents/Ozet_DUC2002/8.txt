governor deukmejian has rightly called the legislature into special session to take necessary action after last tuesday's earthquake.
but the governor should cease distancing himself from the issue of what caused the collapse of the nimitz freeway in oakland.
vulnerable because of his past opposition to a gasoline tax increase that would augment transportation funding, the governor seems more interested in diverting blame than in learning everything possible from tuesday's disaster.
the challenge is to rebuild so that hundreds of thousands of commuters can get back to work.
the special legislative session should consider a temporary gasoline tax increase to fund highway reconstruction.
