the tatars of the crimea and the ethnic germans who lived along the volga were forcibly resettled by stalin.
they were sent to siberia and central asia, and now they want to return to their traditional homeland.
the government has decided to give each of each of the groups an autonomous region in their homeland, but it will be years before they can be relocated.
the russians who have settled in those areas, and wish to remain there must be accommodated before the tatars and the germans can return to the volga.
