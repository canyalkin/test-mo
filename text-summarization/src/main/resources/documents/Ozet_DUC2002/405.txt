today a former ussr supreme soviet deputy from latvia said the adoption of the latvian citizenship law violates human rights, and creates the conditions for a conflict like those in the caucasus.
he said the united states encouraged latvia to pass the law discriminating against the russian-speaking population of latvia.
he then went on to describe a convoluted scenario that has russia supporting the law in order to create a situation that would later benefit russia at latvia's expense.
he wouldn't or couldn't name the sources of the information on which the scenario was built.
