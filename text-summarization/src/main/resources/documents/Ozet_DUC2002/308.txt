the los angeles sports council, in a bid to bring super bowl xxvıı to the rose bowl in 1993, will offer the stadium rent free to the national football league along with all income from concessions and sales of novelty items.
the council selected the rose bowl because it has 103,083 seats.
under a joint agreement, anaheim stadium and the coliseum did not submit bids but they would share in the revenues if pasadena gets the game.
the share is still being negotiated.
one plan calls for the rose bowl to receive 75% of the proceeds; the other two sharing 25%.
