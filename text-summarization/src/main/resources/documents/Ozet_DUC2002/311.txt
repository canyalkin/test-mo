businesses show few signs of cutting back on their activities despite the new tax law's tighter restrictions on what can be claimed as a business-entertainment expense.
one big change for tickets to sporting events like the super bowl: only 80% of the face value of such tickets can be deducted and there must be a "substantial and bona fide business discussion" before, during, or after the game.
as long as business is discussed, airfare and lodging are still 100% deductible and means are 80% deductible.
banquets get 100% deduction if they have at least 40 persons and a speaker.
