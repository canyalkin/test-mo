coal miners from romania's jiu valley, who spearheaded violent anti-reform rampages through bucharest in 1990 and 1991, are once again out on strike, pressing the government for higher wages.
so far the government, unlike its predecessor has not caved in but has begun action to have the strike declared illegal.
romanians, most of who earn far less than the striking miners, appear solidly opposed to the strike.
the miners want more compensation for the difficult conditions in which they work and live.
they are also following their charismatic leader, miron cosma, who led them on previously successful strikes.
