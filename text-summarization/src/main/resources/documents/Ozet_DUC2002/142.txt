this year's academy award show had too much dazzle and glamour, too many endless production numbers, and too many awards with meaning lost to the general public.
the use of presenting couples was clever but wearing and conversation between them was often forced.
the best oscar shows have been emceed by comics who provided continuity as well as a leavening of pomposity.
the show has grown from five minutes to the current 3.25 hours, the time needed to sell sufficient 30-second ads for $375,000 each.
this year's show had its own set of bests, worsts, and mosts in categories of acceptance speech, appearance, behavior, entertainment, etc.
