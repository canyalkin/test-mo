yesterday' announcement of the short-list of six contenders for the1994 booker prize elicited some biting comments.
some of those on the list were characterized as "b-team writers at the best".
this is surprising in a year of good works of fiction that meet the criteria for booker consideration in that they are written in english and are non- american.
they are missing from the short-list, making the criticism more strident.
despite the carping, there will be the usual high interest from now until 11 october when the winner is announced.
