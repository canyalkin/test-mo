albert goldman, author of a new biography of john lennon, is trying to debunk the "undebunkable".
apart from his puerile politics, lennon's favorite topic was his own squalid history.
he talked about his voracious drug use, his perfidy to employees and his sexual promiscuity.
his public loved him in spite of it all.
the theme of his confessions was that his worst days were behind him and that with his wife, yoko ono, he had learned to prize domesticity.
goldman portrays ono as a cynical manipulator who exploited lennon to further her own wish for wealth and fame.
