on sunday an anti-american newspaper in ıran blamed the united states for the death of tens of thousands of people in last week's earthquake, since it plundered ıran's oil and other resources for 25 years preventing application of the national wealth to development of "advanced (anti-seismic) building construction systems".
after its expulsion from ıran, the argument continued, the u.s. imposed economic sanctions and launched plots that halted the renovation of the country.
the paper called on ıranians to reject relief offers by the u.s. and "other governments whose hands are stained with the blood of the ıranian people".
ıran has said it would welcome relief from u.s. humanitarian groups.
