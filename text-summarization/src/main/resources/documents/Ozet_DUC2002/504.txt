the ındian government imposed direct federal rule in kashmir where their security forces are battling to put down rebellion by moslem separatists.
this action follows the killing of at least 29 moslem militants by ındian security forces.
meanwhile, in the pakistani capital ıslamabad, pakistan and ındia began negotiations to repair deteriorating conditions between the two countries.
ındia claims, and pakistan denies, that kashmiri militants cross into pakistan for arms and training.
the announcement of federal rule was made in the belief that the state was too unstable for elected government.
since ındia cracked down on the militants, 792 people have been killed.
