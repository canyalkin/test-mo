the door covering the lens of the hubble space telescope (hst) opened today and mission control told the discovery astronauts they are no longer needed.
when the door was opened, however, it jarred the telescope causing two of its four gyroscopes to stop working and the electronic system to shut down.
by early afternoon a procedure was started to bring the electronics back on line.
on tuesday nasa plans to release its first test image.
the 12-ton, 43-foot-long telescope is named for the late astronomer edwin p.
hubble who discovered in the 1920s that the universe is expanding.
