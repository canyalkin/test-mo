marco, a feisty boxer, walked off with the champion's trophy at ısrael's dog-of-the-year contest held in tel aviv's exhibition center.
this sanctioned, two-day international event gave about 20,000 people the opportunity to see about 800 pretty pouches of more than 50 breeds.
however, organizers conceded there were few if any contestants from abroad.
the "intefadeh", the word used to describe the 9-month-old wave of palestinian violence in ısrael, may have drastically reduced this year's foreign competition as compared with a similar show last year.
still, for dog lovers, the show briefly pushed ısrael's general elections out of the limelight.
