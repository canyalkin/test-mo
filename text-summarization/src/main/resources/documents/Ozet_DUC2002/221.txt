the new 覺raqi-installed government of kuwait claimed that 覺raqi troops began a pullout from kuwait sunday, but the united states doesn't believe it.
the new government is reportedly led by col.
ala hussein ali who holds the four primary ministries.
kuwait's embassy in jordan identifies ali as saddam's son-in-law.
meanwhile the tens of thousands of 覺raqi troops massed near kuwait's border with saudi arabia gave no sign of movement and as u.s., french and british warships steamed toward the persian gulf, president bush said friday that an 覺raqi move against saudi arabia would be attacking u.s.
"vital interests".
he stated saturday that use of force remains an option.
