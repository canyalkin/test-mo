on sunday an anti-american newspaper in ıran blamed the united states for tens of thousands of deaths in last week's earthquake, claiming that because of the u.s.'s plundering of ıran's oil and other resources for 25 years, ıran's national wealth was not applied to development of "advanced (anti-seismic) building construction systems".
later the u.s. imposed economic sanctions and launched "several other plots" that halted the renovation of the country.
the paper called for rejection of relief offers by the u.s. and "other governments whose hands are stained with the blood of the ıranian people".
ıran has said it would welcome relief from u.s. humanitarian groups.
