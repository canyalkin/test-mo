the late jesse owens was honored on wednesday for "humanitarian contributions to the race of life".
president bush presented the congressional gold medal to his widow at a white house ceremony.
at the 1936 olympic games in berlin, owens captured four gold medals.
his performance put the lie to hitlers' boasts.
"the berlin games were to be the showcase of hitler's theories on the superiority of the master race until this 23 year old kid showed up," said bush, ".
.. it was a triumph for all humanity".
mrs. owens said, "despite the many honors, his greatest satisfaction came from his work with youth."
