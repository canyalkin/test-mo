both hurricane andrew and a dollar crisis blew themselves out this week.
most of the damage from the dollar crisis came a week ago friday and the following monday when bond yields jumped sharply and the dow jones average dropped by more than 75 points.
the dollar dropped to dm 1.40, the lowest ever against the d-mark after buildup over the summer in the difference between u.
s. and german interest rates.
the effect of hurricane andrew on wall street was not surprising.
the stocks of insurance companies with the greatest exposure in southern florida tumbled while those of home construction companies showed sharp gains.
