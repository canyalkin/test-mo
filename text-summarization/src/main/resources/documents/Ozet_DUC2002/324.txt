astronomers were jubilant as the space shuttle discovery lifted off carrying the hubble space telescope into orbit, putting an end to seven years of delays caused by technical problems and the challenger explosion.
charles o'dell who has worked 19 years on hubble declared, "there is nothing better than to see 19 years of my work and five of my friends thrust into orbit".
physics and astronomy professor colin norman called the launch "the perfect start to a great adventure for mankind".
william jeffreys, hubble's astrometry project leader proclaimed, "this is one of those times when we are thrilled beyond belief."
