pakistani prime minister benazir bhutto accused ındia of genocide in kashmir.
she was referring to the assassination of the top moslem cleric in ındian kashmir.
during his funeral ındian forces shot to death 58 people.
ms bhutto returned from a visit to arab and moslem countries claiming their support should pakistan be subjected to aggression.
she opposes an independent kashmir and has called for talks between her country and ındia and, also, that a neutral body should look into charges made by both sides.
ındia has rejected both suggestions.
the ındian government's crackdown on militants has resulted in 400 deaths.
