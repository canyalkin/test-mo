ındia suffered a fresh wave of terror last night when an explosion in the crowded trade and residential district of bowbazaar in calcutta destroyed two blocks of flats killing at least 45 people and injuring scores more.
a militant sikh group fighting for the independence of punjab claims responsibility for the blast, but police and the interior minister suspect a foreign group or "an international conspiracy".
the attack came just four days after a systematic bomb attack on ındia's commercial heart in bombay, raising fears of a resumption of last december's intercommunal violence.
last night national and local leaders appealed for calm.
