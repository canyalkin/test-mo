as president bush and soviet president gorbachev prepare for a shipboard summit off malta on saturday, chancellor helmut kohl assured visiting u.s. senators that west germany would not forsake nato to reunite with east germany.
there has been speculation that west germany might be tempted to agree to neutrality if the kremlin stipulates it as price for reunification.
u.s. ambassador vernon a.
walters joined senator richard lugar, head of an american delegation of eight senators, for a 75-minute closed-door talk with kohl.
afterward, senator lugar said the west german's were committed to remain in nato: "without any reservations."
