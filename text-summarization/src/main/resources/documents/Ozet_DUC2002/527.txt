the winner of the 1989 booker prize, britain's top literary award, will be announced on 26 october.
the six novels on the short-list have been named and british bookmakers have established kazuo ıshiguro's "the remains of the day" as a seven-to-four favorite to win the 31,600-dollar prize.
ınterest in the booker this year is expected to be even higher than usual this year because of last year's controversy.
salman rushdie, a british citizen, was an unsuccessful contender last year for his "satanic verses".
ayatollah khomeni alleged that the book blasphemed ıslam, and he threatened rushdie's life.
