robert ballard, an american oceanographer, earlier this month used an ocean-crawling robot to locate the german battleship bismarck.
the battleship is resting under 15,000 feet of water about 600 miles west of brest, france.
Ä±t went down on 27 may 1941.
only 110 of the 2,200-man crew were survived the sinking of germany's most powerful battleship.
structural evidence convinced ballard the germans scuttled the battleship.
only scuttled ships tend to remain in one piece.
under the laws of the sea the battleship is still german property.
ballard said that he would reveal the exact location only to germany.
