communism suffered its first big mac attack thursday as mcdonald's opened a restaurant in belgrade, yugoslavia.
this, its first outlet in a communist country, has 350 seats, employs 110 people and is capable of serving 2,500 meals per hour.
police kept an eye on eager customers who waited in line for hours to get in. the mcdonald's hamburgers, fries and shakes will compete with a local favorite fast-food dish, the pljeskavica, ground pork and onions on a bun.
Ä±n a change to yugoslav eating customs, mcdonalds will not serve alcohol or allow smoking, nor allow customers to linger long after their meal is finished.
