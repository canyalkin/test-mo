the annual academy awards ceremony has generated a wealth of statistics and trivia in its 60 years.
oscar historians chronicle what actors, directors, studios, and films have received the most oscars or been nominated most often.
other factoids concern the youngest, oldest, or posthumous recipients; family members who have been recipients in the same picture; actors nominated in multiple categories, performers who have refused their oscars, those who have never appeared to collect their award; the number of tv viewers, the number of countries watching, the speed of reading the rules, and who decapitated his oscar while practicing his golf swing.
