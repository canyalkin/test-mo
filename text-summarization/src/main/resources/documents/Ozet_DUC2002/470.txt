the 400-foot argentine supply ship, the bahia paraiso, sank tuesday after running aground.
the ship was 600 miles south of cape horn, and about two miles from a united states research facility on the antarctic peninsula.
the 316 people aboard the ship, including 82 tourists, were rescued by power boats after the ship ran aground.
the ship was carrying jet fuel, gasoline, canisters of compressed gases, and other supplies to the argentine esperanza station near the tip of the antarctica peninsula.
there is great concern that diesel fuel would leak and damage the unspoiled ecology of antarctica.
