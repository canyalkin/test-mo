super bowl xxıv was the most watched tv event of the week, viewed by 63% of the viewers.
cbs estimates 109 million viewers, down only 2 million from last year, despite the fact that this year's match was a blowout and resulted in the lowest rating since super bowl ııı in 1969.
each rating point in 1990, however, represents many more households than it did two decades ago.
technically, super bowl ıv in 1970 out rated super bowl xxıv 39.4 to 39.0. but sunday's game had almost twice the estimated 59.19 million who watched kansas city beat minnesota 20 years ago.
