ınvestigators' search for the cause of wednesday's explosion aboard the battleship ıowa is hampered by the absence of eyewitnesses.
all who were in no. 2 turret's gun house where the explosion occurred were killed.
the explosion followed the order to load and prepare a gun for firing, and probably involved the sacks of gunpowder that are rammed into a gun after it is loaded with a shell.
a moratorium was placed on firing 16-inch guns.
former ıowa-class commander adm.
richard milligan heads the investigation.
bodies of the casualties -- one officer and 46 enlisted men -- were sent to dover afb, site of the military's largest mortuary.
