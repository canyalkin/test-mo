five scientists of the united states geological survey, now located in a bunker 12 miles east of mt.
pinatubo, are among the few still at clark air base after the base was evacuated monday in the wake of pinatubo's eruption.
the volcano may already have done its worst, but a geological survey spokesman in california says the volcano's activity is increasing in a way that suggests a massive eruption is imminent.
a massive eruption could cause searing avalanches that would completely cover clark.
Ä±n that case, even personnel caught in a cloud of ash would perish.
