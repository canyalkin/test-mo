philippine president corazon aquino said today she is willing to negotiate a ceasefire with communist guerrillas and former soldiers, reversing a long held policy.
the government blames almost daily explosions in manila on the former soldiers and the communists have been waging a 21-year rebellion.
aquino rejected a call for negotiations in july, but accepted urging on tuesday by a pro-aquino senator to begin discussions.
juan ponce enrile, implicated in a 1986 coup attempt, said he is willing to reconcile.
the last ceasefire with the communists collapsed in early 1987.
defense secretary fidel ramos, who is credited with crushing six coup attempts, has refused any talks.
