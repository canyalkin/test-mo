prime minister thatcher's resignation took president bush by surprise.
thatcher had told the world that she would fight to a second ballot.
however, after being told wednesday evening by her own cabinet officers that they could not support her in the second ballot process, the decision to retire was her only option.
Ä±f someone was to beat heseltine, it wouldn't be margaret thatcher.
mrs. thatcher was a strong supporter of shared anglo- american values.
although she shared a special relationship with former president reagan, relations with president bush were cool at first, warming gradually as the two found common ground.
