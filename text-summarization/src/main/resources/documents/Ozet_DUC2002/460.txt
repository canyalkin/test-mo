saudi arabia will not close the pipeline that carries 覺raqi oil for export across saudi arabia to the red sea.
they feel this might provoke saddam hussein into occupying saudi oil fields 150 miles south of kuwait, thus giving him control of more oil than any country in the world.
the saudis sheltered the kuwaiti ruling family and allowed them to operate a radio, which soon went off the air.
覺t is unknown if it was shut down by the 覺raqis or the saudis.
saudi arabia joined other arab organizations to condemn the invasion.
turkey also would not cut its 覺raqi used pipeline.
