ıraq's occupation of kuwait yesterday has ended two weeks of tension and negotiations.
first, saddam hussein accused kuwait of flooding the oil market and of stealing oil from wells along the disputed border.
tension increased july 24-25 as the u.s. announced a "short-notice exercise" in the persian gulf, kuwait declared a state of alert, and ıraq defied u.s. pressure.
tension eased somewhat when ıraq and kuwait agreed to meet for discussions, but when they met on july 31 ıraq massed 100,000 troops on the border facing kuwait's 20,000-strong armed forces.
the next day ıraq pulled out of the peace talks and yesterday invaded, quickly occupying kuwait.
