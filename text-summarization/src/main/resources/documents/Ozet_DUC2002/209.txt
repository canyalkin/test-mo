supercomputers and satellites helped predict the path and landfall of hurricane hugo in time to allow evacuation of charleston, s.c., but hurricane tracking is not an exact science.
the intensity of hugo was upgraded on the basis of air force reconnaissance just hours before it hit charleston.
there are no reliable computer models for forecasting strength.
to predict the path, supercomputers use satellite data to make constantly changing predictions.
forecasters analyze the predictions, satellite data, the history of similar storms and the current path to make an educated guess about the landfall.
the best information for predicting hurricanes still comes from flying airplanes into the hurricane.
