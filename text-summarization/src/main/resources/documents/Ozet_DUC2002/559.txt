john major continues to face leadership challenges as he enters the second year of his term.
ın an attempt to bolster his support, cabinet ministers rallied behind major yesterday, insisting there would be no leadership election in the fall.
the public show of support did little to dispel doubts among tory mps about major's ability to stay in office.
their doubts were confirmed in the findings of a national opinion poll held by the ındependent on sunday which indicated that michael heseltine was favorite to replace major.
despite efforts to foster unity in the conservative party, major's chances of surviving have shortened to 11/10 against him.
