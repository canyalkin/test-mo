pinpointing the exact location of hurricane hugo's landfall was difficult, but forecasters analyzed computer predictions, satellite data, the history of similar storms and the current path of the hurricane to make an educated guess which turned out to be right.
what is more important, they came up with the answer in time to allow people to evacuate the south carolina coast.
but forecasting hurricanes is still not an exact science.
the most difficult problem with hugo was predicting the intensity of the storm.
the last-minute increase in the wind speed of hugo was provided by air force reconnaissance, i.e. by flying aircraft into the hurricane.
