fighting between police and moslem separatists in srinagar, the summer capital of the jammu-kashmir state killed at least 21 and wounded 100.
police had imposed a 24-hour curfew to quell the violence resulting from the militants, led by the jammu-kashmir liberation front, holding anti-ındia demonstrations.
however, crowds defied the curfew.
heavy rains caused fighting to taper off but the situation remains tense and dangerous.
both ındia and pakistan claim parts of kashmir in a dispute that started after the state was partitioned in 1947.
most of the population of kashmir is moslem while jammu is predominately hindu.
