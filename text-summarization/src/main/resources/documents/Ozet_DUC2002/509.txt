rescuers searched through debris today for victims of an earthquake that ravaged one- third of nepal and parts of 覺ndia, killing at least 650 people and injuring thousands.
officials in both countries said they had not yet received reports from the remote himalayan areas hardest hit by the tremors.
覺n eastern nepal, 50,000 to 60,000 houses were destroyed in the dharan district alone.
monsoons, earthquake damage and aftershocks have paralyzed train service and road travel hampering relief efforts.
覺n 覺ndia, more than 25,000 houses were flattened in darbhanga and munger, and in the district of madhubani nearly 50 villages were flooded.
