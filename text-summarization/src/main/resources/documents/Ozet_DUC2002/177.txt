a one-day strike by coal miners in kazakhstan and the ukraine has grown into a nationwide walkout involving up to 100,000 miners demanding that president gorbachev surrender power to the restive republics.
most of the country's 1.2 million coal miners are still working, but output in some key regions has been halved.
the strike is the new union's first major test of strength.
Ä±t began as a warning in kazakhstan and the ukraine but gradually spread to all of the country's major regions.
previous strikes have made only economic demands.
this time the miners want political concessions.
