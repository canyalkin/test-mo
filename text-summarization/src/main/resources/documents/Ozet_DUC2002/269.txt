americans who rushed to donate earthquake relief funds for the armenian earthquake 18 months ago are responding more slowly to last week's earthquake in ıran.
relief agencies point out that u.s. response to events in the middle east is not as immediate as to those in europe, but expect contributions to pick up when news spreads of the effects on the lives of individuals.
at least 50,000 people were reported killed and 200,000 injured in thursday's quake.
americares brought a shipment of supplies from the united states into ıran on sunday, the first of its kind to be accepted by ıran since the hostage crisis of 1979-80.
