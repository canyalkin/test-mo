ın the recent san francisco earthquake, why did some luxury four-story apartments or office buildings collapse while high-rises escaped virtually unscathed? accordingly, some buildings collapsed because of two things: very poor soil and very poor structural design.
some were built over landfill and others were erected earlier when there were no earthquake codes.
four-story buildings with garages underneath have no walls on one side.
connections break and the front falls.
skyscrapers usually survive because architects factor in wind gusts and earth movement.
ın smaller buildings, contractors make sure that vertical forces--such as snow and ice--cannot force a collapse.
