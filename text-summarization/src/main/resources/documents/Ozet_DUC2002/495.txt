覺ndian border guards fired on hundreds of pakistanis who tried to cross a cease-fire line separating the pakistan-controlled part of kashmir from that held by 覺ndia.
pakistani troops then fired on the 覺ndian security forces.
no one was hurt in the exchange.
a fluid 840-mile cease-fire line separates the 覺ndian and pakistan parts of kashmir.
the conflict over kashmir flared january 20th after a government crackdown and arrest of 250 suspected militants.
they were soon released; however, the arrests sparked the violence.
the majority of the 85 people killed in the violence have been protesters shot by security forces.
