the mcmartin pre-school child molestation case, the longest and most costly criminal trial in u.s. history, closed with a verdict of not guilty for ray buckey and his mother, peggy mcmartin buckey.
the eight man, four woman jury deliberated for nine weeks before acquitting the buckeys of 52 counts of molestation.
a mistrial was declared on 13 other charges on which the jury remained deadlocked.
most of the jurors later said they believed that the children who testified had been molested but that the prosecution had not proven that the buckeys were responsible.
disappointed parents expressed anger at the legal system and the prosecution.
