Ä±n the decade since the death of former beatle john lennon, his wife, yoko ono has issued several albums and collections of his work.
ono says she wants to keep lennon's spirit alive, but others charge that she has made millions with no concern for his legacy.
ono has designed and sold memorabilia from coffee mugs to lithographs, using lennon's image.
ono says that some of the money goes to the spirit foundation, established by lennon and her before his death.
the foundation has contributed to causes ranging from a home for drug-addicted children to bulletproof vests for police officers.
