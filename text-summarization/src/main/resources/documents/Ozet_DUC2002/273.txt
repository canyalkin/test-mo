the ıranian community of orange county, california launched an effort sunday to collect half a million dollars in money, medicine, tents, blankets and sleeping bags for hundreds of thousands of injured and homeless victims of the earthquake in northwestern ıran.
between 60,000 and 80,000 ıranians live in orange county and 150 ıranian doctors practicing there responded to calls for medical supplies.
ın ıran rescue efforts suffered a setback sunday as the strongest aftershock yet with a magnitude of 5.7 hit the rice-growing region of rasht causing mudslides that temporarily closed off an important relief route.
estimated casualties have now reached 50,000 killed and 200,000 injured.
