ıran today welcomed earthquake relief from its bitter enemy, the united states, but specified that aid should be channeled through the red cross and red crescent.
this is one of the very rare instances of u.s.- ıranian cooperation since the countries broke diplomatic relations a decade ago.
ıran reportedly said it would accept aid from all countries, including ıraq, but not ısrael or south africa.
the earthquake which hit northern ıran thursday with a magnitude between 7.3 and 7.7 killed as many as 35,000 people.
more than 6,000 people were pulled from rubble in gilan and zanjan provinces and airlifted to hospitals.
