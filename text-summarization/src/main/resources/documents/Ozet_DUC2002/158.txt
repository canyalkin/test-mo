jurors cited taped interviews by the children's ınstitute ınternational as a reason for acquitting raymond buckey and his mother, peggy mcmartin buckey, on 52 charges of child molestation.
the jurors felt that cıı interviewers asked leading questions and never allowed the children to tell the story in their own words; contaminating the evidence.
jurors said they couldn't tell if the children believed what they were saying or were repeating what parents or cıı interviewers had told them.
the jurors deadlocked on 13 other charges.
while unsure if buckey was a molester, jurors were sure that the prosecution had failed to prove the molestation allegations.
