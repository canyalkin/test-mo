ıraq's army invaded tiny oil-rich kuwait today and with a force of 100,000 quickly overcame the smaller country's 20,300-strong armed forces.
a kuwaiti government official announced that all of kuwait was occupied.
there were immediate repercussions.
president bush froze ıraqi assets in the u.s. and blocked most ıraqi imports including oil.
the soviet union halted weapon sales to ıraq.
on friday soviet foreign minister shevardnadze and u.s. secretary of state baker plan a joint statement in moscow on the invasion, apparently lining up the two super powers on the same side for a change.
the u.n. security council voted 14-0 denouncing the invasion and demanding an ıraqi withdrawal.
