poland's solidarity government's first definitive statement on the issue of a reunified german state said such a state "must be formed gradually and respect poland's borders".
some right-wing west german politicians have called for recovering the 40,000 square miles of territory that germany lost to poland at the end of world war ıı.
the territory is about one-third of present-day poland.
east and west germany have each separately recognized the present border, but there has been no official assurance that a reunified germany would.
poland's foreign minister skubiszewski reassured poles that its government will insist on current borders.
