the countdown began saturday for launching of space shuttle discovery on its mission of hoisting the hubble space telescope (hst) into orbit above the earth's atmosphere.
launch is scheduled for 8:31 a.m. edt tuesday.
the $1.5 billion telescope is expected to start providing significant scientific data in a month or two.
hst is considered to be the greatest advance in astronomy since galileo first used a telescope in 1609.
Ä±t may help test the theory arising from the work of edwin p.
hubble, for whom it is named, that the ever expanding universe was created by a tremendous explosion some 15 billion years ago.
