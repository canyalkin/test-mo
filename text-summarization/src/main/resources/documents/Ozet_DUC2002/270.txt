ıranian news media reacted sluggishly thursday to an earthquake that left 25,000 dead in northern ıran.
for hours the only detailed reporting by the ıslamic republic news agency (ırna) was that tehran residents were either asleep or watching a world cup soccer match when the quake hit.
ırna also underestimated the severity of the quake reporting 10,000 dead late thursday while the ıranian ambassador to the united nations said 25,000 had died.
official radio was off the air when the quake hit and only reported the earthquake 6.5 hours later.
like ırna radio reporting lacked color and description for hours.
