new york city mayor, dinkins, warned jewish groups against protesting the visit of south african anti-apartheid leader nelson mandela, saying the visit might insult the black community.
he also asked jewish leaders to dissuade more radical groups from disrupting the visit.
jewish leaders are concerned that mandela has embraced yassar arafat, chairman of the palestine liberation organization and has compared the palestinian struggle to that of black south africans.
they want him to clarify his position on ısrael and some have said if he does not make a strong statement supporting ısrael, they would hold demonstrations.
