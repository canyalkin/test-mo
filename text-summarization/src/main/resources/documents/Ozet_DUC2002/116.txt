an experiment with more than 1700 high blood pressure patients showed that a blood and urine test can pinpoint those patients most likely to have a heart attack.
the tests, which measure the activity of a blood protein called renin, may also suggest a new risk factor for heart attacks.
the study was conducted on people found to have mild to moderately high blood pressure.
only 12% of these people had high renin "profiles".
but 7 heart attacks in this small group constituted the highest incidents of heart attacks.
the study has implications for drug makers as well as patients.
