soviet physicists, in a rebuff to the soviet union's scientific establishment, voted on friday to nominate andrei sakharov to be a candidate in the march parliamentary elections.
the overwhelming vote, taken in secrecy, came only two days after the governing board of the academy of sciences rejected sakharov's candidacy.
the vote was more an expression of respect for sakharov than a specific endorsement of his political views.
sakharov used the occasion to outline a detailed program that would transform the soviet union.
complicated voting procedures still make it uncertain that sakharov's name will appear on the ballot.
