winnie mandela, wife of african national congress leader, nelson mandela was convicted of kidnapping and sentenced to six years in prison.
her husband has been working since his release from prison 15 months ago, to end the murderous conflict between black political factions.
he has loyally defended her innocence, but anc radicals may use the conviction to turn members against mandela's policy of peace and negotiation and move him aside.
but both de klerk and mandela and their followers have a common interest in creating a new, non-racial south africa.
the next step is formal negotiations.
