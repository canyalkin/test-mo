the securities and exchange board of ındia (sebı) accuses the bombay stock exchange of flouting regulations including those designed to limit excessive speculative investments.
the exchange denies the allegations, but the dispute does nothing to stimulate the stock market where shares have fallen 48 per cent from their peak early last year.
this week's argument is only the latest in a series of disputes which date from sebı's creation a year ago.
brokers claim the sebı fails to understand their needs.
the finance minister is backing sebı to the hilt and singled it out for praise in his recent budget message.
