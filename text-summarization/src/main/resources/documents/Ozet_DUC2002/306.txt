the san francisco 49ers 55-10 rout of the denver broncos was the lowest-rated super bowl in 21 years and the third lowest ever since the 1969 and 1968 super bowls.
the game averaged a 39.0 rating and 63 share.
the rating is a percentage of the nation's televisions; each point represents 921,000 homes.
the share is the percentage of tvs on at the time.
despite the low rating, about 108.5 million watched the game, making it the ninth most-watched tv show ever behind eight super bowls and the final episode of mash.
higher viewership was due to the annual increase in the number of homes with tv.
