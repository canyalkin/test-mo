13 explosions rocked bombay on friday leaving at least 255 people dead and over 1,200 injured.
unlike the riots that racked the city last december, friday's attack was clearly high-technology terrorism carried out with semtex plastic explosives, high-grade timers, efficient organization and money.
ındia's prime minister described the blasts as an attack on ındia's economy and said the search for the perpetrators "may not stop within the country," but stopped short of mentioning pakistan.
the bombay stock exchange plans to resume trading today and the people of bombay have refused to be goaded into violent protest by the bombers.
