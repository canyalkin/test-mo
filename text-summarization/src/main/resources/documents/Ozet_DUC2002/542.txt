a senate armed services committee vote to approve former senator john tower as secretary of defense was cancelled thursday following allegations of recent drinking problems as will as inappropriate behavior with women.
the fbÄ± is looking into the matter and the results of their investigation are not expected until tuesday.
tower stated that he limited his drinking to an occasional glass of wine.
staff members also reported that recently he has been ordering only tonic water with his meals.
tower's work with defense contractors also raised questions with the committee but did not appear to threaten his nomination.
