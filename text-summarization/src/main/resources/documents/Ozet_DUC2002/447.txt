comrade wen jiabao and his party left changsha yesterday to inspect the flooded areas of zhuzhou and xiangtan.
after listening to these two cities' flood fighting and relief reports, he spoke out.
he said that by their work, the cadres and people in zhuzhou and xiangtan rescued a large number of industrial and mining enterprises.
after the water recedes we should rebuild homes and repair the damaged dikes and embankments.
since the peak flood season has not yet arrived we cannot slacken our efforts.
there has been inadequate coordination between urban and rural flood control.
we should learn from this negative experience.
