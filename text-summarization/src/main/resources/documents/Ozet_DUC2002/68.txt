ousted east german leader erich honecker was arrested monday morning morning upon release from hospital and taken to prison.
honecker, who expected to be indicted for high treason, was immediately taken to east berlin's rummelsburg prison.
he had previously been declared to ill to withstand imprisonment.
honecker, the aging hard-line stalinist who ruled east germany for 18 years, had recently undergone surgery for a malignant kidney tumor.
earlier this month, east german prosecutors said honecker and former state security chief erich mielke would be charged with treason and corruption for misuse of their positions and state funds.
