the late robert maxwell was a strong supporter of chess and a chess set was always set up in his office.
malcolm pein, master chess player and director of chess and bridge, told of maxwell's support of the game when he sponsored a section of the world chess championships in new york.
maxwell kept the chess and bridge publishing businesses when pergamon sold to elsevier last year.
although it has taken a year to separate chess monthly and bridge monthly from the maxwell empire, chess and bridge has not moved to new premises in london.
