a british broadcasting documentary claims that u.s. prosecutors pressured japan's wartime prime minister into changing testimony at his trial to avoid incriminating emperor hirohito in war crimes.
general macarthur feared that if hirohito were indicted, it would touch off a guerrilla war and the documentary claims the decision not to prosecute was truman's.
the documentary challenges hirohito's image as a peaceful man, saying he must have know about the massacre of chinese at nanking and knew more than a month in advance of japan's plan to attack pearl harbor.
hirohito died in 1989 at the age of 87.
