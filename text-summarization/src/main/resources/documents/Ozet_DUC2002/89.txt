the new york philharmonic began its leonard bernstein memorial concert series tonight, four days after his death.
although he had led 74 orchestras, the new york was his.
he was laureate conductor and had led it 1,244 times.
the scheduled night of beethoven and shostakovich became four bernstein creations.
his whimsical "candide" and eclectic "serenade", with soloist glenn dicterow, lightened the mourning mood.
but after the intermission, it returned with "jeremiah".
then, mezzo-soprano wendy white wept during "lamentations".
the hebraic elegy, "chichester psalms", was last on the program.
Ä±t ends with bernstein's message for society.
the program will be repeated three more times.
