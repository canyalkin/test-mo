salman rushdie, who was sentenced to death by the late ayatollah ruhollah khomeini, donated $8,600 to victims of last week's devastating earthquake in 覺ran.
rushdie, in hiding because of the 覺ranian leadership's threat to his life, declared, "覺t's quite clear that at the moment, we should be thinking only of the humanitarian issue, which transcends all other discussion".
覺n tehran ayatollah sadeq khalkhali, known as the "hanging judge," said "the foreign media seems to think that by publishing news of aid from salman rushdie to earthquake victims, we will compromise on rushdie's fatwa (edict)".
he indicated that they would not.
