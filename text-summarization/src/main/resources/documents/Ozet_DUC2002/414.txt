mandela, 70, was jailed for life 27 years ago for conspiring to overthrow the government of south africa.
he was recently transferred from prison to hospital for treatment of tuberculosis.
the anc is fighting to end white-minority rule in south africa.
the release may be an attempt to win international support for the south african government.
