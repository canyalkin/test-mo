weather experts are calling for more research and study in an effort to understand the conditions causing the present drought.
at a weather symposium attended by 13 state and national experts, attendees stressed that there were an enormous number of possibilities to consider and that the job at hand was to extend the range of analysis in looking for cause and effect.
a hurricane specialist said this year's hurricane activity is expected to be heavier than normal, but stressed that a hurricanes effect on drought is variable.
even so, some southeastern states get as much as 25 percent of the annual rainfall from hurricanes.
