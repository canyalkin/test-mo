the senate armed services committee, controlled by the democrats, has voted 11-9 along party lines to recommend that the full senate reject the nomination of former senator john tower as secretary of defense.
this comes after allegations that on the 1970s, tower would consume as much as a bottle of scotch in one sitting.
rep. larry combest, who originally made the allegation, later said that tower and a group of friends, not tower alone, had frequently consumed a bottle scotch.
tower, in admitting that he had a drinking problem in the 1970s, promised no to touch a drop of alcohol if nominated.
