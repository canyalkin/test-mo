margaret thatcher broke the mold in english politics when she became that country's first woman prime minister.
even so, critics say she did little to advance the cause of women.
no believer in feminism, mrs.
thatcher believed the battle for women's rights had been won.
women occupy 43 percent of the british workforce yet they generally are paid less and are poorly represented in managerial jobs and parliament.
supporters point to mrs.
thatcher's legislation on work place nurseries and independent taxation for working women.
as prime minister, she angered feminists by emphasizing women's roles as homemakers and care givers.
