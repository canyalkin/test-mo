more than 4,000 workers at a coal mine in jastrzebie, poland went on strike today to demand legalization of solidarity, higher wages and the reinstatement of workers fired for union activities.
workers at a copper mine had staged a protest rally earlier.
the strike comes on the eighth anniversary of the founding of the outlawed trade federation.
solidarity was crushed in 1981, when the government imposed martial law and was banned nearly a year later by parliament.
Ä±n 1980 workers at factories around the port of gdansk joined striking shipyard workers to form solidarity, the first and only independent trade federation in the soviet bloc.
