thousands of miners in the vorkuta region of the soviet union are expanding their strike and are blocking coal shipments.
they are demanding the government fulfill promises to improve living and job conditions.
officials said that the strikes could force fuel rationing during the soviet union's severe winter.
a regional court in vorkuta ruled that the latest round of strikes is illegal, but did not impose any penalties.
coal miners in vorkuta and in ukraine struck for two weeks in the summer, but returned to work in july after parliament passed a resolution, promising reforms.
