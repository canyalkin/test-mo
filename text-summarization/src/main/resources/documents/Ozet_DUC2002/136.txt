the cities of charleston, sc and san francisco have similarities and differences when they were the scenes of two back-to-back disasters: hurricane hugo and the bay area earthquake.
charleston had warning but san francisco did not.
charleston's neighborhoods were littered with debris, 80% of the buildings were damaged, and power was out.
san francisco's streets were passable within a day and power was restored overnight.
charleston, however, in contrast to san francisco, could quickly assess structural damage and it lost no major economic area such as the bay bridge.
both have experienced delays in disaster relief from the federal government.
