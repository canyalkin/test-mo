ground controllers at the goddard space flight center finally made contact with the hubble's two main antennas after trying for more than six hours to lock on.
the telescope's two low-gain antennas, which can be used in an emergency, were working well.
a goddard spokesman said a pointing problem and the inexperience in dealing with a new spacecraft was the cause.
the shuttle discovery will follow 46 miles behind the hubble, nasa's most expensive unmanned spacecraft, until controllers are sure it is operating properly.
an earlier problem with unfurling a solar power panel was resolved.
the next milestone is opening the aperture door.
