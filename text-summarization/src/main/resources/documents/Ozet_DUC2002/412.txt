president gorbachev warned saturday that growing ethnic unrest across the soviet union was endangering the political and economic reforms, and even threatening the nation's existence.
he acknowledged that the early soviet effort to pull the 100-plus ethnic groups into a unified culture was a cause of the present strife.
last month troops were sent to armenia, azerbaijan and georgia to maintain order.
groups in latvia, estonia and lithuania are advocating secession.
one hundred died last month in vicious assaults against mesketian turks in uzbekistan, and there is new violence in an area of georgia populated be azerbaijanis.
