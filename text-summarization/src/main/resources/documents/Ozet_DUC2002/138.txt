the academy awards are criticized for their unfairness when films get nominated but their directors don't, perhaps out of professional jealousy.
for instance, director steven spielberg has never been nominated for an individual achievement even though his films are the biggest moneymakers in history.
the ırving thalberg award for consistently high quality of production has come in handy for acknowledging giants who were overlooked and for salving the academy's conscience.
spielberg received the thalberg award in 1987.
ın 1986 the directors guild named him best director.
films that became classics have been overlooked, too.
"citizen kane" won only for its script.
