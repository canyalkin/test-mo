the 1990 los angeles marathon has an impressive list of commercial sponsors.
mercedes-benz of north america is the presenting sponsor of the race, making it one of ten companies that not only pay to be called sponsor, but also put money outright into the race or provide products and services.
the marathon is not yet a world-class event, but it is the best-marketed, slickest and sponsor-driven of the world's major marathons.
president bill burke and vice president marie patrick who have marketing backgrounds drive the race's marketing philosophy.
