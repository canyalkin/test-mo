east germany's ousted secret police chief, erich mielke, threatened to break former communist leader erich honecker's neck when the two faced each other in jail.
after the popular revolt last fall that ousted the communist regime and opened the way for german unification, mielke and other former communist leaders were jailed.
mielke remains in custody, honecker was released for health reasons.
many of the prison guards had worked for mielke's secret police and might interpret his threat against honecker as an order to kill him.
honecker will be moved to a west berlin prison after unification if his health improves.
