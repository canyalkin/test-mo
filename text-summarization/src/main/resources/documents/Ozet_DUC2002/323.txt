five astronauts boarded discovery today preparing to send the hubble space telescope (hst) into orbit at an altitude of 380 miles.
the day after launch one of the astronauts will use the shuttle's mechanical arm to lift the 24,250 pound telescope into space.
then discovery will follow the hst at a distance of 40 miles until its lens cap is opened.
the hst will not provide scientific data for a month or so after liftoff, but nasa plans to release its first image next week.
hst will provide astronomers with 10 times better resolution and 25 times more sensitivity than ground-based observatories.
