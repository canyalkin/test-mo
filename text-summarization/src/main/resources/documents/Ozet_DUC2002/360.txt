soviet president mikhail gorbachev prepared to return to moscow from the crimea and reclaim power after the coup against him collapsed and its leaders fled.
crowds cheered outside the russian parliament building, which served as headquarters for resistance to the coup led by boris yeltsin.
the national legislature demanded gorbachev's reinstatement and nullified the coup leaders' emergency decrees.
the three-day coup was one of the most tumultuous events in recent history and its failure could be a fatal blow to efforts to thwart reform drives by gorbachev and yeltsin.
huge anti-coup demonstrations were held in moscow, leningrad, and other cities.
