the earthquake that struck northern 覺ran thursday resembled the armenian earthquake of dec.
7, 1988.
both killed about 25,000 people most of whom died as their fragile homes collapsed.
the 覺ranian quake was the stronger measuring 7.7 (vs.
6.9) on the richter scale.
the 覺ranian quake occurred just after midnight, so most people were inside asleep when it hit.
覺t occurred in an area where most of the adobe buildings are on a flood plain of loosely deposited soil that shifts causing structures to collapse.
thursday's quake was the strongest ever recorded in that area where two major plates of the earth's crust meet.
