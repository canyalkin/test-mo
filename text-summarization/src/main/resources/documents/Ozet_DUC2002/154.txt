although hurricane gilbert had lost much of its muscle, it caused floods and mudslides after it reentered mexico on friday.
after more than 24 hours of rain, the santa catarina river overflowed its banks in monterrey, sweeping at least 10 policemen to their deaths and overturning buses loaded with evacuees from matamoros.
the police officers were on a rescue mission around midnight when they died.
the hurricane has killed more than 109 people and the death toll is expected to rise.
although the worst appears over, in many locations, hurricane victims are without food, drinking water, electricity, gasoline and communications.
