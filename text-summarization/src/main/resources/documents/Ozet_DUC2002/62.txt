edgar bronfman, president of the world jewish congress, announced a scheduled conference in the berlin villa where nazi leadership met to implement the "final solution" against europe's jews.
the purpose is to formulate a formal declaration regarding german reunification.
he said that a part of their planned moral statement to be made on may 8 is to see that the holocaust cannot happen again.
bronfman said he doesn't fear a resurgence of anti-semitism from a united germany; in fact, reunification may cause a decline in anti-jewish feeling.
they won't be blaming jews for a divided germany, he explained.
