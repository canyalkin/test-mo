patrick edward purdy was a student at cleveland elementary school from kindergarten through the third grade.
although over 600 of the 980 students are asian, authorities are not certain that race was a motive.
police are still investigating what caused purdy to open fire at the school with an ak-47, killing five students and injuring 29 more.
his grandmother was at a loss to explain his behavior and an aunt described him as a loner and a child alcoholic.
only about 200 students returned to cleveland elementary today.
counselors were there to help the children and each child received a stuffed animal.
