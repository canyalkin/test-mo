michail gorbachev urged all sides to take their time in deciding the fate of erich honecker as former east german leader spent a seventh day of refuge inside the chilean embassy in moscow.
germany wants to try honecker for ordering the shooting of people who attempted to flee to the west during his years in power.
but speculation lingers that german politicians have little interest in trying a man who may possess embarrassing secrets.
gorbachev did not exclude the possibility that honecker would leave for north korea in the next few days.
outside the chilean embassy, several dozen demonstrators demanded humane treatment for honecker.
