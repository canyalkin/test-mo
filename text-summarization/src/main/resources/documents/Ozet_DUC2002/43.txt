general accident (ga), the leading british insurer, estimated yesterday that its losses from hurricane andrew might reach $40 million; however, ga has only a half-percent share of the florida market and the estimate is based on the assumption that ga's catastrophe insurance would be triggered by the extensive claims.
the company's loss adjustors guess that losses to all insurers might exceed $8 billion.
other insurers have estimated that losses from the storm that hit florida and louisiana might be anywhere from $1 billion to $20 billion.
at this time no one is certain of the extent of losses.
