us intelligence officers warned the white house a week before the soviet coup of a "real possibility" that hard-liners in the kgb or soviet military might try to block the signing of the new union treaty.
the proposed treaty reduces moscow's centralized control and strengthens powers of the 15 soviet republics.
soviet president gorbachev was reinstated after the bungled coup attempt but may become "irrelevant" and a figurehead under the new treaty.
the coup's failure may open the way to further reform as the communist party becomes less of a political force.
however, a benign soviet union cannot be automatically assumed.
