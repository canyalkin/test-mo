scientists do not know what fuels a budding hurricane as development begins.
ıt is a mysterious convergence of winds, moisture and temperature near the equator.
about one out of six of the 50 to 60 low-pressure troughs moving west out of africa each year develop into a higher level storm.
a tropical trough, or wave, becomes a depression when its winds start swirling.
when sustained winds reach 39mph, the system becomes a named tropical storm.
ıt reaches hurricane status when sustained winds hit 74mph.
scientists believe that hurricanes' primary role is to transport heat from the lower to the upper atmosphere.
