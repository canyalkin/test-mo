world leaders sent japan messages of condolences after emperor hirohito's death, but painful memories of world war ıı still generated criticism of the japanese monarch.
president reagan and the president of the soviet union sent condolences but in south korea and taiwan reaction was cool.
both countries suffered under the japanese military during world war ıı.
most historians believe that hirohito was a powerless figurehead but had to approve orders to attack pearl harbor and the invasion of asian countries.
he called on his nation to surrender in 1945.
as one man said, "only now has world war ıı finally come to an end."
