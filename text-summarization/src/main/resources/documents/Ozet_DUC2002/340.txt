copying what is regularly done for tennis and ski enthusiasts, creative tour companies here and abroad have come up with "marathon tours".
a typical package includes air fare, lodging, specified social activities in connection with the marathon, entry fees, and a guaranteed spot in restricted entry races.
for those not up to the full 26.2 miles of a marathon, some cities offer shorter races for some.
london holds the largest marathon, and is the most popular spot for groups.
among other cities holding marathons are berlin, paris, rome, stockholm, vienna, brussels, budapest, munich, bangkok and tel aviv.
