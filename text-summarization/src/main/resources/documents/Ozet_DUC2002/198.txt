the battleship ıowa steamed home from puerto rico friday under its own power, following an explosion on board that killed 47.
ınvestigators interviewed crewmen and reviewed a videotape of the explosion made by an officer to record the firing of the big guns.
reportedly, deaths in the gun turret's upper chamber resulted from the explosion and fire while those in lower levels were from suffocation when the blast sucked all the oxygen out of the spaces.
after extinguishing the fire, crew removed shells and powder from two other gun barrels in the turret.
senate armed services committee will hold hearings on the explosion.
