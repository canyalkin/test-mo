soviet official newspapers, which one denounced the beatles as harmful, joined a worldwide celebration and paid tribute to the late john lennon who would have been fifty this year.
state radio broadcast his music and interviews about him.
the celebration was a dramatic turnabout from soviet repression of beatle's fans and suppression of their music in earlier times.
their music was banned and the soviet press condemned them.
one newspaper article attributed lennon's success with soviet youth in part because he was a rebel, like many of them and was a difficult teenager.
one fan said his music crosses borders easily.
