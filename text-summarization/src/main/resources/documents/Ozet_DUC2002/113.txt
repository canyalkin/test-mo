a natural substance called transforming growth factor (tgf) beta appears to be able to limit damage to cardiac cells following a heart attack.
a study at the jefferson medical college in philadelphia showed that laboratory rats induced to have heart attacks, suffered 50 percent less cell damage after injections of tgf beta than rats that did not receive tgf beta.
the tgf beta seems to block the action of other substances, such as tumor necrosis factor, that can cause blood vessels to narrow following a heart attack.
any experimental treatment of human heart attack victims with tgf beta is at least a year away.
