emphasizing that the central 覺ntelligence agency was not surprised by 覺raq's invasion of kuwait, a spokesman said the agency gave useful and timely information to policy makers and continues to do so.
president bush had been warned that what originally looked like an 覺raqi bluff was quickly turning into a serious deployment.
among the assessments conveyed was a conclusion that president saddam hussein's force would be capable of penetrating kuwait or saudi arabia.
furthermore, as the buildup grew, the c覺a became more alarmed because hussein is so unpredictable and because he has been known to carry out his threats.
