the opening of a musical about the late robert maxwell may be delayed if the attorney general, sir nicholas lyell qc has his way.
he has applied to the high court for an injunction to halt the production, fearing that it would prejudice the trial against maxwell's two sons, kevin and Ä±an.
the musical is being produced by evan steadman, a former chairman of one of maxwell's private companies.
mr. steadman indicated that he intended for the show to go on and would contest the application for an injunction.
press coverage of the late publisher is already of concern to the lawyers for the maxwell brothers.
