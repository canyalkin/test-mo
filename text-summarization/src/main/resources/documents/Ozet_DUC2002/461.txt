the united states urged the u.n. to impose broad economic and military sanctions on ıraq.
the world body is expecting 14 members of the 15-member security council to do so, cuba being the holdout.
ıt would be the first time since 1967, when it brought sanctions against rhodesia, that the security council took such action against a member state.
kuwait's u.n. ambassador said that the ıraqi-installed government was employing "pure blackmail" by saying it could not ensure the safety of foreigners if their governments support sanctions.
the u.n. role assumes increasing significance since the divided arab nations have failed to act.
