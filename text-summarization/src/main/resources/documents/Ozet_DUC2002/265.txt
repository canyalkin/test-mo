the earthquake that struck northern ıran on thursday killing about 25,000 people registered 7.7 on the richter scale.
many of the victims lived in fragile homes built of a ceramic-type brick or adobe that collapses easily and the quake occurred just after midnight, so most people were inside asleep when it hit.
ıt occurred in an area of ıran where most of the buildings are on a flood plain of loosely deposited soil that shifts and allows structures to collapse.
the quake of 7.7 magnitude was the largest ever recorded in that area where two major plates of the earth's crust meet.
