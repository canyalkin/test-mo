an ıraq-kuwait crisis erupted july 17 when ıraqi president saddam hussein accused kuwait and the united arab emirates of costing his country $14 billion in lost revenue because of their overproduction of opec oil limits.
he further demanded $2.4 billion for oil allegedly stolen from a common field and the cancellation of $15 billion in war loans that kuwait gave to ıraq.
through mediation by saudi arabia and egypt, kuwaiti and ıraqi officials met in jiddah to negotiate issues.
meanwhile, ıraq massed 100,000 troops and 300 tanks on kuwait's border.
ıraq has historically laid claim to all of kuwait.
