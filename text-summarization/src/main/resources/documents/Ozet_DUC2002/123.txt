british prime minister margaret thatcher's future will be decided today in a crucial first vote of tory members of parliament.
should her former defense minister, michael heseltine, succeed in taking control of the part from thatcher, she would have to give up the prime minister's job, a position she has held since 1979.
credited with reviving the british economy in the 1980s, she is now viewed as a hindrance to britain's interests in the development of a strong and united europe.
Ä±n some quarters it is said that the british never liked thatcher, but they respected her and voted for her as long as she delivered the goods.
