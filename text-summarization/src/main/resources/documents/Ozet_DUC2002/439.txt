following tensions caused by ıraqi accusations that kuwait stole ıraqi oil and exceeded opec production quotas to drive down prices, 100,000 ıraqi troops entered kuwait at dawn, seizing the palace and government buildings.
ıraq bombarded kuwaiti ports and military airports and moved toward oil facilities.
200 kuwaitis were killed or wounded, including the emir's brother.
leaders fled to saudi arabia.
ıraq claimed it invaded at the request of revolutionaries who staged a coup and established "the provisional government of free kuwait", which was dissolving parliament and would hold future free elections.
kuwait denied this.
the al-sabah family has ruled kuwait for 250 years.
kuwait requested us military intervention.
