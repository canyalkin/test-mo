federal judge laughlin waters ruled thursday that the oscar statuette itself has no copyright protection.
the academy of motion picture arts and sciences had sued chicago-based creative house promotions, manufacturer of an employee-incentive trophy called the star award, for copyright infringement.
the star award depicts a naked, muscular male similar to the oscar but two inches shorter and holding a star instead of a sword.
the judge said the statuette became part of the public domain prior to jan 1, 1978, the effective date of the copyright act of 1976.
from 1929-1941, oscars did not bear the symbol denoting copyright.
the academy will appeal the ruling.
