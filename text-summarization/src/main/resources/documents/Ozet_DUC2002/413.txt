a 3-year campaign that has succeeded in getting northwestern to award an honorary degree to jailed south african nationalist leader, nelson mandela has raised objections from some faculty and students.
the degree is to be accepted by south african archbishop desmond tutu in boston at a benefit dinner.
some faculty and students, including many blacks, say no effort was made to include them.
south africa's white- minority government says it will free mandela, only if he renounces the use of violence by forces seeking political power for blacks in the country.
northwestern has not yet received approval to award the degree from mandela's family.
