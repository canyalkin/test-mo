the national union of mineworkers said an estimated 200,000 gold and coal miners in south africa will begin a strike for higher wages and better working conditions in what it said would be the largest job action to ever affect the nation's mining industry.
gold and coal account for more than half of south africa's foreign currency earnings.
mine owners, in anticipation of a strike, have been building stockpiles and do not expect the strike to have much impact unless it lasts over a month.
other mines, such as diamond mines, may go on strike if the current striking miners' demands are not met.
