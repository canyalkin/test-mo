president bush is expected to name melissa wells, currently ambassador to mozambique, to be ambassador to nicaragua.
the administration apparently believes that a female ambassador can relate better to the new president violeta chamorro.
several male career diplomats with experience in latin american affairs were passed over in the selection of ms wells.
ms wells was born in estonia and has no latin american experience but does speak spanish.
the us and nicaragua have not had ambassadors in each other's country since july 1988 when president daniel ortega expelled the us ambassador and president reagan expelled the nicaraguan ambassador.
