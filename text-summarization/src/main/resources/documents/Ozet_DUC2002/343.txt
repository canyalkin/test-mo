a biography of former beatle john lennon by albert goldman, discloses a sometime unflattering portrait of both lennon and his second wife yoko ono.
goldman claims that lennon spent much of a three-year span sleeping or smoking marijuana.
between 1976 and 1979 the author says lennon was a recluse.
lennon also spent most of his adult life as an anorexic.
the biography also details yoko ono's $5,000-a-week heroin habit in 1979.
goldman spent more than six years researching the book, interviewing 1200 friends, relatives and associates of lennon, who was murdered in new york in 1980.
